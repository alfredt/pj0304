0,"I suppose I could sit here and fret over a day in the not-too-distant future when a robot powered by artificial intelligence(AI) will spit out newspaper columns like this one, rendering redundant columnists like me. After all, there have been reports that computers can already churn out news reports that read almost as well as those written by journalists, and in a fraction of the time taken.  The thought of being replaced by software is depressing and, I might add, self-defeating.  That is why I disagree with the way technological advances and the future of work are all too often framed in either-or terms: either robot or human worker, either AI or human brain.  Here are a few recent examples of headlines in local media that fall into this category : ""AI may replace a third of graduate jobs: Study"", published on April 6; ""Evidence that robots are winning the race for American jobs"", published on March 30; and ""Robots may take over 10 million jobs in Britain in 15 years"", published on March 25.  Such reports reflect how automation and AI are more often than not viewed - not just in Singapore but in other parts of the world too - as threats to jobs and human well-being. An extreme example of such thinking is exemplified by historian Yuval Noah Harari, author of the best-selling book Sapiens: A Brief History Of Humankind.  In an essay for ideas.ted.com bearing the headline The Rise Of The Useless Class, he writes: ""The most important question in 21st-century economics may well be: What should we do with all the superfluous people, once we have highly intelligent non-conscious algorithms that can do almost everything better than humans""  He adds that ""the idea that humans will always have a unique ability beyond the reach of non-conscious algorithms is just wishful thinking"" because ""every animal - including Homo sapiens - is an assemblage of organic algorithms shaped by natural selection over millions of years of evolution"".  I question if human beings can be reduced to ""assemblages of organic algorithms"" but even if that view has some basis, it remains unclear what time frame Mr Harari has in mind for his doomsday scenario.  For the foreseeable future, though, I propose a reframing of the challenge, along the lines put forth in a 2015 Harvard Business Review (HBR) article by Professor Thomas H. Davenport and Ms Julia Kirby entitled Beyond Automation.  They write: ""What if we were to reframe the situation  ""What if, rather than asking the traditional question - what tasks currently performed by humans will soon be done more cheaply and rapidly by machines - we ask a new one: what new feats might people achieve if they had better thinking machines to assist them  ""Instead of seeing work as a zero-sum game with machines taking an ever greater share, we might see growing possibilities for employment.  ""We could reframe the threat of automation as an opportunity for augmentation.""  New feats, growing possibilities for employment, opportunity for augmentation - such phrases are not common currency in talk on the future of work. Yet they should be.  A change of focus from automation to augmentation changes the outlook for humans.  The first implies they will be replaced by robots while the second points to them collaborating with robots to achieve that which is impossible today.  Such a paradigm shift has the power to unlock human potential for it encourages people to stop agonising over cost and headcount cuts and imagine instead ways to bring about growth - business growth, economic growth, personal and professional growth.  I take heart that the man championing this paradigm shift from automation to augmentation - Prof Davenport - is considered an expert in information technology and management. A research fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Centre for Digital Business, he penned the article with Ms Kirby, an HBR editor-at-large.  They also quote MIT economist David Autor, who closely tracks the effects of automation on labour markets and points to the immense challenge of applying machines to tasks that call for flexibility, judgment or common sense.  He says: ""Tasks that cannot be substituted by computerisation are generally complemented by it"", a point that ""is as fundamental as it is overlooked"".  So what to make of those dire forecasts of millions of jobs - including graduate jobs - being lost to robots and AI My sense is they are unhelpful. The impact of technology differs from place to place, depending on context and local circumstances. The rise of robots is much less of a concern for a small, labour-scarce country like Singapore than it is for a large, labour-rich one like China.  Worries about mass unemployment may in fact be overblown, the McKinsey Global Institute concludes in a report issued in January - A Future That Works: Automation, Employment And Productivity.  ""While much of the current debate about automation has focused on the potential for mass unemployment, predicated on a surplus of human labour, the world's economy will actually need every erg of human labour working, in addition to the robots, to overcome demographic ageing trends in both developed and developing economies.  ""In other words, a surplus of human labour is much less likely to occur than a deficit of human labour, unless automation is deployed widely,"" the McKinsey team writes.  Yes, the nature of work will change. As processes are transformed by automation of certain tasks, ""people will perform activities that are complementary to the work that machines do (and vice versa)"". The key word here is complementary, that is, humans and robots working together.  There will also be changes in how companies are organised, the bases of industry competition and business models. So yes, there will be disruption and humans will have to adapt. But the McKinsey report presents a more nuanced picture of what will happen to jobs by breaking them down into activities.  ""We consider work activities a more relevant and useful measure since occupations are made up of a range of activities with different potential for automation.  ""For example, a retail salesperson will spend some time interacting with customers, stocking shelves, or ringing up sales. Each of these activities is distinct and requires different capabilities to perform successfully,"" the McKinsey team explains.  Its research shows that based on current technology, the three types of activities most susceptible to automation are: physical activity or operating machinery in a predictable environment, collecting data and processing data.  It estimates that ""less than 5 per cent of occupations can be fully automated"" and ""about 60 per cent have at least 30 per cent of activities that can technically be automated"".  ""Workers"", it concludes, ""will need to work more closely with technology, freeing up more time to focus on intrinsically human capabilities that machines cannot yet match.""  It would be sweet irony if the entry of robots into the workplace helps us become more fully human. I certainly look forward to that day, and to a machine helping me write better columns.",2017-04-22,That is why I disagree with the way technological advances and the ... and AI are more often than not viewed - not just in Singapore but in other ...,Please stop saying I'll be replaced by a robot,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/please-stop-saying-ill-be-replaced-by-a-robot

2,"If you chance upon an empty canoe moving by itself off Seletar Island, do not be alarmed.  The yellow robot kayak roaming the Strait of Johor looking for signs of trouble is the latest weapon in the war against killer algae.  It is armed with sensors that measure water temperature, salinity and chlorophyll, among other things.  Scientists are using it to monitor waters for harmful algal blooms which have killed fish and marine life en masse here in the past.  Scientists simply programme the robot to survey a designated area and collect data in real time that can then be used to map out patches of algae so scientists know how they are spreading.  Since 2010, scientists from the Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI) at the National University of Singapore and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Smart) Centre for Environmental Sensing and Modelling (Censam), have been harnessing advanced technologies to monitor environmental stressors, including algal blooms.  The project is funded by the National Research Foundation.  There are 270 known algae species found in coastal waters off Singapore. Here are some: Commonly found in the Johor Strait, it has toxic compounds that are known to cause massive fish kills during blooms. During the mass fish death in 2015, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore found elevated levels of Karlodinium veneficum in seawater samples. The genus consists of more than 40 species and a third of them are toxic. Four Alexandrium species occur in Singapore waters. One produces a toxic compound that kills young sea bass and seahorses, while another causes paralytic shellfish poisoning, which can be fatal. This genus is known to have 12 species and can release toxins into the environment as aerosols, which can cause respiratory problems in humans. Recreational beaches have been forced to close due to blooms caused by such species. Eating shellfish contaminated with the algae may also result in neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, which causes headaches and aching muscles, among others. An undetermined species was observed in the Singapore Strait in a study published last year.  ""The sea, as a research field, is a very challenging environment to collect data. Autonomous fleet of vehicles are able to collect relatively more data, more accurately as opposed to traditional methods,"" said Mr Tawfiq Taher, a senior research manager at Smart Censam.  ""Due to the harsh nature of the sea, the robots are required to be robust and resilient to the extreme weather conditions.""  Local fish farms here have been badly hit by algal blooms in recent years. Just two years ago, 77 farms were affected by the blooms which wiped out 500 to 600 tonnes of fish - about one-tenth of local farms' yearly produce that year .  There are 118 Singapore coastal fish farms in the East and West Johor Strait, and the southern waters, where most rear fish in net cages in the sea. There are another seven fish farms on land.  Last year, the farms produced about 5,000 tonnes of fish, accounting for about 10 per cent of the fish eaten here.  Dr Sandric Leong, a senior research fellow with TMSI who is co-leading the project, noted that algal blooms are linked to many factors, including slower or warmer water, high nutrient levels and discharge from land agriculture.  ""Advanced technologies assist in finding the blooms which are still in the early development stage so that the public can be alerted,"" he said.  Dr Leong and his TMSI team are also using other technologies to help track and detect algal blooms with greater efficiency.  They include a machine which can identify algae species in a few hours instead of days.  An underwater camera is also able to operate at depths of up to 2km, to capture images of algae lurking deep in the sea.  National water agency PUB is also using technology to monitor reservoirs and waterways. It has developed a life-sized robot swan, with the NUS Environmental Research Institute and TMSI, to measure chlorophyll levels and water quality in reservoirs.  The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) said it monitors the water quality around the nation's fish farming areas.  ""The use of autonomous surface vehicles (ASV) is relatively new in Singapore but such technologies can help to complement AVA's monitoring efforts,"" added a spokesman.  ""On some occasions, we have tapped on the water quality data from NUS' ASV trials to assist in our assessment of water quality in the East Johor Strait.""",2017-03-28,The yellow robot kayak roaming the Strait of Johor looking for signs of ... and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Smart) ...,Robot kayak joins fight against algae,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/robot-kayak-joins-fight-against-algae

In another country thousands of kilometres away, a manager checks his mobile device to ensure these machines and robots on the distant production floor are running under specific conditions so that they achieve maximum output.  Welcome to the new era of manufacturing, on display this week in an exhibition at the Singapore Expo.  Manufacturing Technology Asia 2017, which opened yesterday, aims to bring businesses large and small, technology providers and service firms together to share experiences and opportunities.  It is in part prompted by the potential created by technological advances.  By interacting with seasoned industry players, businesses will gain a better idea on how advanced manufacturing technologies may be adopted in their own operations.  The event, organised by trade event organiser UBM SES, will also allow businesses to explore technologies already available on the market, connect with providers and work on new solutions.  The exhibition, which comprises 301 companies from 26 countries, is showcasing a spectrum of innovative technology, including additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), optics and photonics, precision engineering and semiconductor manufacturing.  Mr Johan de Villiers, managing director of technology provider ABB, said: ""Adopting new technology is absolutely essential for firms.  ""It ensures the competitiveness of Singapore in a global economy. For a country with limited resources, the ability to use technology will continue to be a key competitive advantage for Singapore.  ""It also presents a key export opportunity for Singapore as it develops a workforce that adds value in the digital environment. Those skills are going to be a large part of the future global economy.""  Ms Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry, mentioned at the opening ceremony the importance of preparing Singapore's manufacturing sector for technological developments.  She said: ""Advanced manufacturing presents significant opportunities for our economy, companies and people.  ""Events such as the Manufacturing Technology Asia exhibition serve as useful and important platforms for key stakeholders to exchange ideas, and discuss how we can work together to drive the industry's push towards advanced manufacturing.""",2017-04-04,PHOTOS: MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY ASIA 2017 ... they are moved from one conveyer belt to another by tireless robotic arms with pinpoint precision. ... on display this week in an exhibition at the Singapore Expo.,The new era of manufacturing is here at Expo event,http://www.straitstimes.com/business/the-new-era-of-manufacturing-is-here-at-expo-event

7,"Businesses in Singapore have long complained about a shortage of labor which they say has pushed up wages. Now they're seeking to push back against labor costs, replacing people, with robots.     Meet e-bot, a food delivery robot that can accept payment go down ramps and take lifts with other staring passengers.    E-bot is employed by e2i, a government agency that assists workers and employers through career guidance and job matching services. Against the backdrop of rising labor cost and a shortage of manpower, e2i wants to showcase e-bot as a possible solution for future employment in Singapore.    ""I think the issue out there is that we need something to be showcased, piloted, tested, test-bedded, so when we first did it, we had to overcome some of these challenges: how the robot communicates with the home base, how do we get the safety of the robot in place, because this is a crowded campus,"" said Gilbert Tan, CEO, Singapore Employment & Employability Institute.    Safe interaction between human and machine is key for a project like this. E-bot is smart enough to avoid obstacles, but sometimes human error could stop it from doing its job. And then, it needs a helping hand.     ""The robot has two emergency locks on the side. Perhaps someone was curious and touched the buttons. E-bot was locked in the lift for a long time. So I went to look for it and unlocked it. It walked back slowly,"" said Aisha Wong, Cafe Worker.    Singapore has allocated more than 320 million dollars to support the national robotics program since last year. The finance minister says robotics technology can enable Singapore to work more efficiently in a tight labor market. It can also create more high value-added jobs.    One company thats convinced that automation and robotics is the way forward is SATS. The airport service and in-flight catering company controls 80 percent of Changi Airports ground handling and catering business.  In the past few years, SATS has managed to grow its business but maintain labor cost, thanks to productivity measures such as robots and automated guided vehicles.  The company CEO says although technologies make the organization a lot more efficient, its the people who are leading the changes.  ""Because the technology on its own without the support of the people wont work,"" said Alexander Hungate, CEO, SATS.  ""The draw back of a lot of these new technologies is that they are fundamentally less flexible than human beings and so you need the human element to work out how they can be best used because its about complimenting the passion and the creativity of people with technology to make them more productive.""    So will robots take over human jobs in the future The answer is a definite yes and its happening now. But the good news is that they are only there to make humans more productive and more creative.

8,"They have come up with spin-off companies, new technology and breakthroughs, but the time is up for the five research programmes under the prestigious Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Smart) initiative.  Moving forward, Singapore's National Research Foundation (NRF) - which funds the effort - will look at new proposals and research programmes which are relevant to Singapore, it said.  Meanwhile, the over 200 full-time researchers at Smart, hired on contract basis for the expected term of the research programme, will have to wait and see if their contracts are renewed.  Smart's environmental sciences and infectious diseases programmes will cease when their decade-long term expires at the end of the year. Three other programmes, which research into areas such as future urban mobility, low-energy electronic systems and technologies for the healthcare industry, will also end when their tenures are up from next year onwards.  The five programmes have resulted in a number of spin-off companies. One example is Visenti, a Smart spin-off which manages water technologies and sensors. It has since been acquired by global water technology leader Xylem.  Smart has also worked with the National University of Singapore on a robot kayak, which monitors the waters in the Strait of Johor for harmful algal blooms that killed fish and marine life en masse here in the past.  However, an NRF spokesman pointed out: ""NRF reviews and refreshes the portfolio of programmes... as part of a continuous process to increase the impact of research conducted.""  A Smart spokesman told The Straits Times that it has submitted a proposal for a new research programme, Urban Sustainability and the Environment. NRF, however, said it has not accepted the proposal, although it could follow up on some ""promising"" areas.  ""Smart will work with NRF to identify possible partners for collaboration,"" said the NRF spokesman.  Smart, established to much fanfare in 2007, is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) largest, and only, international research centre.  It was the first of several international research centres established under an initial $1 billion initiative called Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (Create).  Create, which has also established centres with universities such as Cambridge University, aims to foster joint research programmes between the world's top research universities and Singapore-based research institutes, as well as to recruit and nurture a pool of young talent here.  All NRF-funded programmes at Create are awarded for five years in the first instance and can be renewed once, with a maximum span of 10 years - a process in line with international practices. There are regular reviews, during which the research directions are either reaffirmed, modified or concluded.  Some programmes failed to make it past the five-year mark, including those with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and Peking University.  NRF has also identified new areas of research that Singapore should invest in. For example, last year, it pumped in $25 million to start a five-year marine science programme to spur research into how the Republic can better cope with emerging challenges such as climate change, heavy shipping and urbanisation.  ""In line with Singapore's Smart Nation initiative, we are also looking to support the development of digital capabilities in areas including cyber security, data science and artificial intelligence,"" said the NRF spokesman.  Dr Erik Velasco, aresearcher from Smart's environmental sciences programme,said the programme was the first environmental research centre in Singapore, and has over the past decade conducted scientific work on topics of relevance for Singapore's sustainability and welfare. The centre has done studies on domestic air quality, haze, and algae blooms, for instance.  The closure of the environmental programme, known as the Centre for Environmental Sensing and Modelling, was a loss of human capital and knowledge. ""I am pretty sure other institutes will continue the research work started... Hopefully, they will follow the same approach of openness to the public.""  However, Dr Velasconoted that the closure was an opportunity for NRF to review its programmes and policies according to Singapore's needs. ""Singapore needs to invest in scientific institutions and not just in research projects. Permanent institutions will provide sustained advice and support to both the authorities and society. Singapore needs to rely on knowledge generated by scientists based in Singapore. Such scientists need to be part of Singapores society and share its problems. Famous and well reputed scientists working somewhere else may provide good advice, but wont be able of identifying such problems neither of providing adequate solutions.""

9,"McKinsey & Company's new Singapore Digital Capability Centre (DCC), opening on April 11, will help local companies harness emerging technological changes - collectively known as Industry 4.0 - that are disrupting industries around the world, according to Oliver Tonby, McKinsey's South-east Asia managing partner.  MCKINSEY & Company's new Singapore Digital Capability Centre (DCC), opening on April 11, will help local companies harness emerging technological changes - collectively known as Industry 4.0 - that are disrupting industries around the world, according to Oliver Tonby, McKinsey's South-east Asia managing partner.  Mr Tonby said Industry 4.0 describes four broad disruptions. They are: increasing data availability and interconnectivity; analytics and business intelligence (BI) capabilities, including artificial intelligence (AI); advanced human-machine interactions such as cobots (a collaborative robot that interacts with humans in the workplace); and advanced production methods such as 3-D printing.  All these are expected to transform the entire life cycle of a business' product, from customer order to after-sales.  The Singapore centre is part of a global network of five DCCs that McKinsey has around the world. The Singapore centre will be in partnership with A*Star's Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC) and, apart from Singapore, will also serve the South-east Asian region. McKinsey is spending US$15 million upfront in establishing the centre and will employ 10 new full-time employees. According to sources close to the project, McKinsey expects that more investments in the centre will be ongoing as it expands and increases its scope. Most of the money is likely to go into hiring more skilled personnel.  Talking to The Business Times, Mr Tonby noted that with manufacturing accounting for one-fifth of Singapore's economic output, ""the facility is in line with the nation's push to become a regional hub for advanced manufacturing (AM)"".  He added: ""Singapore, in our view, is also uniquely positioned to become the home of smart manufacturing pilots. The DCC is also designed to be especially relevant to regionally important sectors including discrete manufacturing, semiconductors, oil and gas, electric power, and mining.  ""We see DCC Singapore playing an integral role in the ecosystem, drawing on ARTC's state-of-the-art facilities and research and development capabilities across A*Star, ranging from manufacturing, data analytics, virtual process modelling, and digital solutions for complex manufacturing processes.""  David Low, ARTC's CEO, told BT that his organisation would be jointly conducting manpower training sessions with McKinsey for companies to get an appreciation of lean manufacturing and Industry 4.0.  ""These sessions will leverage DCC's learning modules across themes such as predictive maintenance, digitised performance management, procurement and supply chain. The DCC will utilise part of ARTC's Model Factory testbed that will be launched in the later part of the year,"" Mr Low said.  The Model Factory testbed will provide a learning environment for companies to experience advanced manufacturing technologies, so that they can acquire and deepen their knowledge and skills in such technologies, thereby reducing the risks involved in adopting AM in their own factories and processes  ARTC will also groom talent for Future of Manufacturing technologies through workshops and on-the-job training. At any one time, ARTC has at least 30 interns from the various Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) such as NTU (Nanyang Technological University), NUS (National University of Singapore, SUTD (Singapore University of Technology and Design), Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Nanyang Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic.  As new technologies such as robotics, digitalisation, IoT (Internet of Things) and analytics come online, the manufacturing sector is changing dramatically. Advanced manufacturing is one of the areas identified by the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) as a growth cluster. CFE noted that Singapore should augment its current base of complex manufacturing capabilities, and prepare its workforce to take on the jobs created by the integration and adoption of AM technologies.  Recently German semiconductor giant, Infineon Technologies, announced that it is spending 70 million euros (S$104.8 million) in five years till 2021 to develop a smart factory at its backend manufacturing plant in Singapore. Infineon said it would progressively increase the level of automation, connectivity and control within the factory. It added that Industry 4.0 ""is not only the next step in automation, but will substantially change how we work; machines are becoming more intelligent and will be able - to a large extent - to control and optimise themselves and the production process in which they are involved"".  McKinsey's Mr Tonby said the company's DCCs around the world will simulate different companies, depending on the needs of the region. ""For example, the Singapore facility will feature a gearbox manufacturer whereas the German facility will feature a woven smart wristband producer. Ultimately, the realistic production environment is the biggest differentiator as all centres will feature similar capability learning modules which will be developed in synergy and then tailored to the simulated business.""  He added that the Singapore centre will showcase applications beyond the four pillars of Industry 4.0 - data analytics, robotics, 3-D printing and connectivity - to ""include technologies that can be adopted across the entire value chain encompassing product development, procurement and supply chain"".  The Singapore facility will offer companies at different stages of their Industry 4.0 transformations with the following help:  Among the many technology showcases on offer at the DCC, one will be on predictive maintenance. ""New technology today uses real time data to predict and prevent breakdowns and can reduce down time by 50 per cent. At the DCC, participants will learn about these new technologies and also pilot them on site, before applying them to their own setting. We think this approach can be transformational in the adoption of Industry 4.0,"" Mr Tonby said.  ARTC's Mr Low noted that Industry 4.0 is still a relatively new concept and not all companies are convinced of the value that these technologies can bring them.  Companies need to understand how they will be left behind if they do not adopt Industry 4.0, as the future of manufacturing will see a move towards the replacement of labour-intensive processes with disruptive technologies such as digital manufacturing, robotics and automation, he said, adding: ""To remain relevant, companies must identify and learn about the types of advanced technologies which can make a significant difference to their businesses, and open up new revenue streams.""  Mr Low added that with strong government support in this space, along with a well integrated ecosystem of relevant government agencies, researchers and the industry, Singapore is in a good position in the adoption of Industry 4.0.

10,"The city-state will also host an inaugural Defence Technology Summit in 2018 as it looks to become a global player in modern military advancements.  SINGAPORE: A starting seed grant of S$45 million a year will be given to two new laboratories in the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and DSO National Laboratories organisations, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in Parliament on Friday (Mar 3).    Modern militaries are powered by technology, and the next-generation SAF (Singapore Armed Forces), even more so, he said. Our defence technology organisations will gear up to support changes.    To foster more experimentation and innovation, DSO will set up a robotics lab in April this year and DSTA will expand to include an analytics and artificial intelligence lab.    At the former, defence engineers will collaborate on prototyping, integration, simulation and testing of systems prior to field trials for the SAF. The work on robotics has already begun, said Dr Ng. Six Singapore Infantry Regiment soldiers are currently experimenting with unmanned aerial and ground vehicles to perform missions. The Navy has gone further and is putting Unmanned Surface Vehicles which can navigate and avoid collisions autonomously into operations.    The SAF, working with the Ministry of Home Affairs, has already developed countermeasures to potential drone attacks. These systems were deployed in the last NDP (National Day Parade).    DSTAs new lab will exploit the real-time information that can be derived from the Internet of Things and platforms, said the minister.    The realisable potential is enormous. For instance, our Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre monitors more than 1,500 commercial shipping vessels in our waters daily. It uses AI to generate unique signatures for each, through collating information from multiple sources, including social media. It then detects any deviations from this signature, he explained.    This AI-embedded method detected a possible ISIS supporter on board a tanker in 2015. That person was barred from disembarking in Singapore. Finding this needle in a big haystack is only possible through modern means.    Singapore will also host an inaugural Defence Technology Summit in early 2018. Targeted as a biennial event, the summit will be organised by DSTA together with Singapores universities, A*STAR and Government agencies like GovTech, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, National Research Foundation and Singapore Economic Development Board.    Singapore can lead in defence technology, even though we are small, said Dr Ng. The Summit will provide a global platform to invite leading figures and luminaries to come share their views, provide a window into the future, allow us the opportunity to network and increase our access to new ideas and innovation.    In his speech, Dr Ng also revealed that Singapore has around 5,000 defence engineers and scientists, with the number of related scholarships and awards on offer due to be increased by 40 per cent - up to 170 from 120 today - by 2025.",2017-03-02,"Singapore to invest S$45m a year in new defence tech labs for ...

13,"Cage-free, user-friendly collaborative robot arms affordable for enterprises of all sizes have now become the market driver within industrial robotics. The 2016 annual result of Universal Robots is a testament to that market growth, with revenue reaching DKK 662 million (US$98.4 million) and delivering a profit of DKK 92 million (US$13.7 million) before tax.  President of Universal Robots, Jrgen von Hollen, considers net income to be satisfactory and expects revenue growth of 50 percent or greater in 2017, which means that the company will stay on target to reach DKK 1 billion (US$148.6 million) by the end of 2017.  We need to stay ahead of the curve and drive innovation in everything we do. Scaling the business to continue to deliver growth year-after-year is a key priority. Compared to 2015, we have more than tripled our investments in 2016, especially in R&D, enabling us to maintain our product leadership position, and allowing us to offer the cobot technology platform of choice, said Jrgen von Hollen. Equally important has been our continued investment of more than 50 percent into the Universal Robots staff resource base in 2016, extending our capability, know-how and reach globally.  Universal Robots continues to gain market share in developing markets, doubling its global presence with local offices in 11 countries, up from five offices in 2015. The company is now represented with a presence in the USA, Spain, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, China, Singapore, India, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. The company also continues to scale a strong distribution channel covering more than 50 countries worldwide.  Eight years after Universal Robots sold its first cobot, the global collaborative robot market has entered a new phase of growth. Before the invention of the cobot, automation of manufacturing facilities was limited to highly structured tasks. As a result, many industries had to rely on hand assembly for the more dynamic and flexible functions in their production processes. However, with the Universal Robots cobot, companies are now able to apply flexible, easy-to-use, safe technology allowing them to scale and grow their businesses.  The advantage of Universal Robots cobot is its universal application for all sizes of companies, from small to large. Our technology has been an enabler for all companies  not just large corporations  to integrate automation into their production processes. What also differentiates us has been our focus on growing a global eco-system of technology partners in our UR+ platform. The UR+ platform offers customers access to application solutions leveraging a global developer resource base that is continuously innovating, said Jrgen von Hollen.  As a first mover and leading cobot manufacturer, Universal Robots has been able to rapidly grow its global market share, taking advantage of the impressive growth of the market to date. We are committed to grow our market share as the collaborative robot market experiences continued, explosive growth over the coming years as small and medium businesses adopt cobot technology, said Jrgen von Hollen.  In the spring of 2015,Teradyne, a leading supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications, acquired Universal Robots. The close collaboration between Teradyne and Universal Robots has allowed Universal Robots to leverage Teradynes global coverage and capabilities.  Universal Robots was co-founded in 2005 by the companys CTO, Esben stergaard, who wanted to make robot technology accessible to all by developing small, user-friendly, reasonably priced, flexible industrial robots that are safe to workwith. Since the first robot was launched in 2008, the company has experienced considerable growth with the user-friendly robots now sold in more than 50 countries worldwide.

15,"Much like how personal computers transformed the way people saw and used technology, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Programme Office Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said the personal, general-purpose robots would revolutionise the way such technologies feature in people's lives.  SINGAPORE: Much like how personal computers transformed the way people saw and used technology, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Programme Office Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said the personal, general-purpose robots would revolutionise the way such technologies feature in people's lives.    He was speaking on Friday (Feb 10), at the opening panel discussion of this years Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Hacking Medicine  a weekend-long hackathon aimed at finding solutions to improve healthcare and eldercare through the use of personal robotics.    ""This revolution of the personal general-purpose robot - capable of sensing, processing and doing things, would be even bigger than the revolution that was brought about in the last 30 years by the personal computer, said Dr Balakrishnan, to an audience of around 160 participants including engineers, clinicians, designers, developers, researchers and business people.    We want Singapore to be one of these nodes where new ideas, crazy ideas, will change the world. Will liberate human beings from the burdens of age. Will help us remain masters of our lives and still retain our humanity, still retain our connections with other human beings and make life better.    Participants will develop software and hardware applications on Loomo  a Segway robotic platform, in focus areas of mental health, rehabilitation and recovery, community care or long-term care. These would allow the robots to become robot assistants capable of understanding and engaging with elderly, as well as patients with conditions such as Alzheimer's and others. Participants may also define a suitable challenge statement based around the theme of Social Robotics for Eldercare.    Dr Balakrishnan reminded participants that such solutions had to address real human needs and remain safer than existing technology or treatments. They also had to be more cost effective and financially accessible to all, while remaining acceptable and resonate with human beings on a psychological and emotional level.    When youre dealing with physical devices capable of sensing and responding in a very sophisticated way, that whole usability and human-robot interface is going to be a very rich field for research and development, said Dr Balakrishnan.    Winners of the hackathon will be announced on Sunday, with a top prize of US$5,000. Their projects will also be featured on a panel at EmTech Asia on Feb 15, while selected teams will be supported by agencies such as government-owned private innovation entity SGInnovate to further refine and scale-up solutions.    At the end of that well put some money behind those with real potential, because wed also like to build not only for Singapore, but for other countries as well, said SGInnovates Founding CEO Steve Leonard.    Healthcare is a really big challenge for us. And we think about providing care for people in that age  they need more help physically, they need more help mentally, and thats why we think this robotics platform allows us to find new ways to provide that care.

16,"Have you ever imagined yourself creating a complex machine part or even a human windpipe on a screen, then seeing it take on physical form right before your eyes  Or leading a team of tireless workers who need to be reprogrammed once in a while  These are jobs already being done by 3D designers and robot coordinators. Not many people have the skills to do these jobs yet, because they have not been around for long.  At least not in a big way.  But in the economy of the future, you can expect more jobs like these to be created.     Children learning how to make their own robots using Lego pieces during a holiday workshop on robotics and game design at In3Labs. Robots and computer programs are helping do jobs ranging from delivering room service to providing financial advice, and workers in some industries are already feeling the heat. ST PHOTO: LAU FOOK KONG     While it is hard to identify the specific skills students and workers need to acquire to keep up with these changes, one skill that will come in handy is the ability to continually learn new things.  As Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say said earlier this month, as businesses transform, more old jobs will be destroyed. But new jobs will be created and existing jobs will be transformed too.  What this means for workers is that instead of staying with a single employer for life, it will be common to move through multiple employers - and take on multiple careers - throughout one's working life.  ""Each time we move from one career to another career, we will have to learn new skills and adapt to a new environment to regain our employability, time and time again,"" Mr Lim said.  Understandably, many workers are worried about adapting to these changes, and concerned about how their livelihoods will be affected.  With robots and advanced computer programs helping do jobs ranging from delivering room service to providing financial advice, workers in some industries are already feeling the heat.  But technology also creates new products, such as 3D printing for companies to make prototypes quickly rather than outsourcing this process, and jobs, such as for rapid prototyping technicians.  Jobs will disappear. But better- quality ones will be created.  For example, in advanced manufacturing, some 23,000 jobs are forecast to be displaced over the next seven years, but more than 22,000 new jobs are expected to be created.  These new jobs will pay on average 50 per cent more than those lost, a recent study by Boston Consulting Group found.  SKILLING UP FOR NEW JOBS  However, these changes wrought by technology and other forces also mean the job market will go through some labour pains.  Layoffs last year rose to the highest level since the global financial crisis in 2009. Unemploy- ment involving Singapore residents also crept up slightly.  Professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) are hit harder by the churn as it takes longer to train for a different job at these levels.  People who took a break from work, or who struggled to find a new job after being laid off, often have a hard time proving that they have the relevant knowledge and skills for a job.  This is why the Government is putting more resources into helping this group find new jobs, such as by subsidising their wages via the Career Support Programme.  PMETs can also work and get training at the same time through over 50 Professional Conversion Programmes in sectors that are expected to grow in the near future.  Unlike in the past, a degree is no longer a guarantee of lifelong employment in a well-paying job.  But opportunities are there for those who excel in technical skills to do well, even if they may not have academic qualifications.  Being quick to pick up new skills will help students and workers adapt to changing opportunities. This entails going deeper to master a chosen field and excel in it.  One tip experts have for workers is to keep abreast of the latest trends and technology, which can help bring in new ideas for employers to try out and add value.  At the same time, they recommend picking up transferrable skills that can be applied in other jobs or industries, such as being able to understand and use data, or to market an idea.  The Committee on the Future Economy has called for more opportunities for workers to acquire deep skills and use them on the job.  A medley of initatives is available to help students and workers upgrade their skills and knowledge, including study awards, work-study programmes, internships and career guidance from as early as primary school.  The $500 SkillsFuture Credit given to all Singaporeans aged 25 and above can be used to defray the cost of over 18,000 training courses.  Other measures have been put in place to help those who have years of work experience, but may not have the skills needed in sunrise industries, find new jobs.  One is the new Attach And Train programme announced in this year's Budget for up-and-coming industries like logistics. Workers can be trained while on attachments at companies that are not ready to hire staff yet.  As more focus is placed on pushing Singapore companies to break out of the local market and start creating products and services for the region and beyond, students and workers will also be encouraged to innovate and learn to work with overseas partners.  Policymakers, too, are constantly trying to learn more about what the future holds for Singapore's workforce.  Data is one aid they hope to use to help answer questions like these: How much investment is Singapore getting How many jobs will these create Which industries and companies will grow What skills will workers need for these jobs  Answers to these questions will help better prepare workers for jobs and later match them to jobs.  The National Trades Union Congress started a Future Jobs, Skills and Training unit this year to gather data on specific companies and industries where new investments and jobs will be over a three-year time frame.  The research will be shared with training providers and institutes of higher learning that can use the information to develop more relevant skills and training courses.  There have also been calls to use the data from the job posts on the national Jobs Bank more fully. For example, if a vacancy for a particular type of job is hard to fill and keeps getting re-posted, that could mean more Singaporeans need more skills in that area.  The Manpower Ministry has also made it compulsory, since Jan 1, for companies to report retrenchments within five working days, if five or more staff are retrenched within six months. This is so that the Government and unions can act on the data and offer the affected workers help more quickly.  If we wait for skills gaps to appear before workers start training for them, there will always be a lag time and the risk of structural unemployment - where the available skills of workers and the skills needed to fill jobs do not match.  That is why Singapore is trying to stay ahead of the curve.  It has rolled out Industry Transformation Maps to chart strategies for 23 industries, covering over four-fifths of the nation's gross domestic product.  Six have been launched, for the logistics, hotels, precision engineering, food manufacturing, food services and retail industries.  These should provide some guidance for companies.  The education system also needs to be tightly integrated with industry needs, all the way from schools to adult education and training centres, to provide guidance for students and workers.  For all the efforts by the Government, individuals, too, must take responsibility for their careers, and not have a sense of entitlement.  When changes come, those who can pick up new skills quickly will fare better.  So if there is any skill to get better at, it is the ability to keep learning.

17,"Check out the stunning views from the North Star observation capsule.  For those who are not fond of flying, going on a cruise provides an excellent alternative.  As big cruise ships go, Royal Caribbean International cruise line has been a popular choice with travellers.  Almost every year, it unveils a new ship packed with more impressive features.  Ovation of the Seas is the third in the Quantum Class, and this latest ""smart ship"" is also the cruise line's most technologically advanced.  Built last year, it can accommodate up to 4,819 passengers.  Cutting-edge innovation greets guests at the Bionic Bar, where drinks are mixed with acute precision and served by robot bartenders. It is so impressive that there is always a crowd standing there to marvel at the robots in action.  Another technologically-enhanced feature is its radio-frequency identification (RFID) wristbands which can replace its Sea Pass cards, allowing stateroom access and on-board purchases.  Non-fans of cruises tend to feel that there is nothing much one can do on a vessel for more than a day. Ovation of the Seas has certainly changed my mindset in this regard.  Throughout my three-night getaway cruise to Penang earlier this month, I found myself spoilt for choice with the number of facilities available.  The ship features some unprecedented first-at-sea experiences such as the Ripcord by iFly, an adrenaline-inducing skydiving simulation for thrill-seekers; North Star, a mechanical observation capsule that transports guests about 100m above sea level for a 360-degree view of the ocean; a huge entertainment and indoor sports complex complete with bumper cars, roller-skating and more.  You can even try your hand at rock climbing or learn surfing on board.  For those who prefer to relax or swim, dip pools and jacuzzies are aplenty, and strategically located to give you breathtaking views of the sea.  If the sun is not your friend, then head to the indoor pool.  In the evenings, guests can catch a movie under the stars, or dance the night away at the outdoor pool deck.  Ovation also boasts Royal Caribbean's largest and most advanced staterooms.  There are unique loft suites and ground-breaking virtual balcony staterooms, bringing an exterior view to interior rooms through huge digital displays.  The Ovation has 16 restaurant concepts and signature dining venues, as varied as what you may find in most cities. At Cafe@Two70, you get a panoramic view of the sea.  The luxurious dining space transforms into a technologically-advanced entertainment arena in the evening, equipped with 18 projectors and floor-to-ceiling windows that can be transformed into any scene, creating an immersive experience for passengers.  The awe-inspiring talent showcased on board are testament to Royal Caribbean's high entertainment standards that combine technology and special effects - make sure you pre-book your seat for the shows as they run out early.  Travellers on the Ovation can also enjoy what is reportedly the fastest Internet at sea for a reasonable fee.  Ovation of the Seas will have a Hong Kong season in October. It will sail round-trip from Hong Kong on fivenight cruises to destinations such as Okinawa (overnight), Hue/Danang (Chan May) and Nha Trang (Cam Ranh) in Vietnam.  Theres also a nine-night repositioning cruise from Hong Kong to Singapore in November with stopovers at Sanya, Hue/Danang (Chan May), Nha Trang (Cam Ranh) and an overnight in Ho Chi Minh City (Phu My).  The ship will be back in Singapore in April 2018, with a five-night round-trip cruise to Penang and Phuket and a 12-night reposition cruise to Tianjin with stopovers at Hue/Danang (Chan May), Ho Chi Minh City (Phu My), Hong Kong (overnight) and Seoul (Incheon).",2017-04-20,"... drinks are mixed with acute precision and served by robot bartenders. ... to Royal Caribbean's high entertainment standards that combine technology and ...

19,"Robots may soon take over cleaning and painting high-rise buildings here, thanks to a new automated gondola system co-developed by Singapore electronics company Elid Technology International and Nanyang Technological University (NTU).  Called the OutoBot, the locally built system was launched yesterday as a commercially ready product after two years of research and development, with the aim of improving productivity while enhancing workplace safety.  The robot was developed in response to a 2015 call by the Housing Board for proposals to automate the painting of building facades to enhance worker safety and productivity. It will soon be tested on selected public housing blocks in consultation with HDB.  The robot requires only two workers for the washing or painting of a building facade, instead of the usual five.  One worker will operate the robot remotely while the other performs the role of a safety officer, but both do not have to be on the gondola.  OutoBot is equipped with a robotic arm and a spray nozzle that can shoot high-pressure water jets to clean surfaces or to spray paint. The system is designed to use the existing gondola mounts found in many high-rise buildings.  Most of the fatal accidents at construction sites in the last decade were the result of a fall from height, though not all involved gondolas. The move towards automation is also in step with recent measures to boost productivity within the construction sector. Said Elid's managing director, Mr Dennis Lim: ""Using our new robot, we have shown that a labour-intensive job can be transformed into one that can be easily done by an older worker and, at the same time, eliminates the risk of employees having to work at heights.""  Elid claims that OutoBot's current iteration is able to reduce painting and cleaning time by 30 per cent and paint wastage by 20 per cent as it ""does not suffer from fatigue"". A high-rise building typically takes around three months to paint, said Mr Lim.  But Elid was tight-lipped on the cost to use the technology.  Building maintenance contractor Yeong Wai Teck said the technology looks promising and, if successful, could address labour woes in the construction sector.  Said the managing director of Aegis Building and Engineering: ""With the OutoBot, we can potentially look to hire younger people who are interested in technology, or older people who might not be physically able to brave the weather on a gondola for an entire day.""  He added: ""It is going to be very expensive, but we think that in the long term, the overall advantages of automation will outweigh the initial costs.""",2017-03-15,"Robots that paint, clean HDB blocks to be tested shortly ... co-developed by Singapore electronics company Elid Technology International and ...","Robots that paint, clean HDB blocks to be tested shortly",http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/robots-that-paint-clean-hdb-blocks-to-be-tested-shortly

The hall features some other advanced technologies that are based on the institute's research and carried out by related Chinese companies, such as a hotel service robot, which can be sent by receptionists to a guest's room carrying inside what the guest asks for, and a cell phone chip engraving device that used to be costly imported from Western countries.  The hall also showcases an agricultural machine that can refine harvested rice from straws, a super big high-definition screen of about 110 inches, the largest in China, and an electronic Mandarin-written book attached with a pen that pronounces the words it points to in Tibetan language. The hall also has two average-sized, well-shaped electronic cars with rechargeable batteries.  ""We call the smaller one a 'small ant.' It's all made of aluminum to be very light. It can be charged for 10 hours per drive of 250 kilometers. The bigger one here that costs 20,000 U.S. dollars and goes 300 kilometers each drive has been available in the market since 2016,"" Miao said.

22,"Drivers headed to Robinson Towers in the Central Business District will no longer have to worry about wasting time circling the building's carpark for a vacant space.  When the building reopens in the fourth quarter of next year, after a five-year redevelopment, it will feature a new automated system that makes use of robots to park cars.  Guided by lasers, cameras and markings on the ground, the robots will ferry cars of up to 2,600kg from a drop-off point to one of 90 parking spaces.  The system, developed by engineering firm MHE-Demag, is believed to be the first such application of the technology in Singapore.  Though such robots have been used for several decades to transport goods, the technology has more recently made inroads into carparks in the United States and Germany.  The system could increase the capacity of a carpark by more than 40 per cent as it allows cars to be parked closer together. The relatively small size of the robot - 5m long and 2.1m wide - also allows it to manoeuvre in narrow spaces.  Unlike other mechanised parking systems, this one does not require steel supporting structures or parking pallets, said MHE-Demag sales and markets regional director Klaus Schilling.  ""No additional building provision is required for the system and it can be adapted into a conventional parking provision in any building development easily,"" he said.  While the firm declined to say how much it will cost, a similar system by Chinese firm Yee Fung Automation - introduced in Nanjing last December - is said to have a price tag of around $200,000.  But the parking fee at Robinson Towers will be ""similar"" to other carparks in the area, said Mr Schilling.  Across the road, at CapitaGreen, daytime parking costs $3.10 a half-hour on weekdays.  Conventional mechanised parking systems - which use mechanical car lifters to move a car to a storage space - can be found at several locations here, including three Housing Board carparks in Changi Village, Yishun and Bukit Panjang.  During peak periods, retrieving a car from these carparks can take 10 to 15 minutes.  MHE-Demag said its system offers faster parking and retrieval, and the average time to retrieve a car - which can be done with a mobile app - will be about two minutes.  The firm is looking at introducing the technology at ""several other locations"", but did not disclose details, and has also started to introduce it elsewhere in the region.  Robotics expert Marcelo Ang said that while it will make parking more convenient, the high cost of purchasing and maintaining such a system could deter widespread adoption of the technology.  ""Building owners will have to weigh how much it costs against what benefits it will bring,"" said Dr Ang, who is acting director of the National University of Singapore's Advanced Robotics Centre.",2017-02-07,"Guided by lasers, cameras and markings on the ground, the robots will ferry ... to be the first such application of the technology in Singapore.",Where carpark valet is a robot,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/where-carpark-valet-is-a-robot

24,"Japan is ahead of the curve in robotics technology, and Singapore can tap this expertise to meet its challenges in productivity, eldercare and energy efficiency, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in Tokyo yesterday.  These are issues that Japan also faces, and Singapore has been watching developments in the North-east Asian nation very closely, he told reporters at the end of his four-day introductory visit to Japan.  One key challenge the two states face, he said, is boosting productivity amid a tight labour market.  There is an ""added sense of urgency"" because the size of the local workforce has started to shrink in Japan and will be reaching its peak in Singapore, given low birth rates.  In last month's Budget, Singapore earmarked more than $450 million for the National Robotics Programme over the next three years to help firms adopt robotics technology so as to boost productivity, noted Dr Balakrishnan yesterday.  This would also involve training to equip the workforce with skills to work with robotics, which he called a ""new and promising"" area.  ""We're hoping Japanese companies have an opportunity to engage in investment and transfer of technology (which) will be mutually beneficial to our countries,"" said Dr Balakrishnan, who is also the Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative.  Eldercare is another mutual challenge, and Dr Balakrishnan said it was worth studying how Japan has extensively tapped robotics in nursing and caring for senior citizens.  ""Issues such as dignity and convenience require design thinking (in) the interface (and) the way humans relate. You can't change humans, but you can change and redesign the machine interface,"" he said, adding that this would require further research and development.  A third area was energy efficiency. Dr Balakrishnan, who was formerly Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, said Singapore has worked well with Japan leading up to the recent conclusion of climate change talks.  This had culminated in 175 countries signing an accord last Friday to curb climate change.  Dr Balakrishnan, who represented Singapore at the ceremony, said yesterday: ""The impetus to focus on energy efficiency is even more urgent. We're looking at how some of the Japanese technologies for energy efficiency and robotics, which Japan is very advanced in, can also be imported or applied in Singapore.""  Beyond Singapore's ties with Japan, the Foreign Minister also touched on China and the South China Sea. He reiterated the Republic's stance that it is not a claimant state in the vital sea and does not take any sides on the merits of competing territorial claims.  He said: ""We want a rules-based multilateral world order, we want to have avenues for the peaceful resolution of differences with full respect for diplomatic and legal processes.""  Dr Balakrishnan's trip coincided with the 50th anniversary of Singapore-Japan diplomatic ties that were established on April 26, 1966.  Besides robotics, Dr Balakrishnan yesterday also cited trade and air services as two areas for even closer collaboration.  The landmark Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement is currently under review, he noted, while Singapore has been promoting the further liberalisation of a bilateral air services agreement.  ""Our airports - Narita and Haneda in Tokyo and Changi in Singapore - can increase our positions as vital air hubs,"" he said, through having more flights and fifth freedom rights on both sides.  These rights allow a carrier to fly from its home country to another one before picking up passengers and flying on to a third country.",2016-04-27,"Japan is ahead of the curve in robotics technology, and Singapore can tap this expertise to meet its challenges in productivity, eldercare and ...",Singapore can learn from Japan's use of robotics technology: Vivian ...,http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/singapore-can-learn-from-japans-use-of-robotics-technology-vivian-balakrishnan
25,"Cloud computing has the potential to revolutionize the field of robotics, but there are key considerations to look into before you leap.  AsianScientist (Oct. 29, 2016) - By Oliver Tian - According to the International Federation of Robotics Statistical Analysis, the global robotics industry is projected to grow from US$20 billion today to US$80 billion by 2025.  China, already the global leader in the robotics sales market, is targeting to achieve a robot density of 150 industrial robots per 10,000 workers by 2020. Not to be outdone, Japan has plans to triple its spending on intelligent machines to 2.4 trillion yen by 2020.  Against the backdrop of a tightening labor market and rising manpower costs, adopting robotic technology could boost productivity while strengthening competitiveness and generating growth at the same time, thus helping to retain staff. Robotics is also one of the pillars of Singapores future economy, with strong government support in the form of the National Robotics Program.      Robotics on the cloud  But when planning to deploy robotic applications, we need to think about how each application can be quickly assimilated into our existing work systems, and at what scale. The best way to do this is to choose technology and business partners that have flexibility and scalability built into their offerings, so that when the time comes, you can seamlessly expand into new markets as necessary.  One key consideration for enabling robotic systems is cloud computing. Like the human brain, the cloud receives signals from sensors and actuators which are analogous to the limbs of the body. In turn, the limb nodes receive instructions from the brain to take action.  Like reflex nerves, however, some robotic touch points may have embedded logic to respond instantaneously, bypassing the cloud. Such local processing is a reflexive action rather than an analytical response to a trigger or change in status. Some degree of short-term memory and local processing power can be located in the robot itself for these unthinking reactions, but context and long-term memory are ultimately provided by the cloud. Such a design provides continued functionality in the event of temporary disconnection with the cloud.  Advanced artificial intelligence needs massive back-end computing power and memory management to support the decision making needed for robotic perception. The more powerful the robot (in terms of decision making and processing), the more powerful the back office will need to be. In other words, increasing robotic sophistication increases the potential to offload compute-intensive tasks like image processing, voice recognition, data comparison and analytics with high latency decision making, to the cloud.      The challenge of communication  Whilst the processing capability of the cloud is important, what makes robot applications unique is the potential of the cloud to both mess-up and make sense of the robots context based on the huge volume of data collected. Upon smart filtering and analysis, this tacit intelligence can complement other continuous inputs coming from the robots own sensors. Furthermore, centralized processing will also enable multiple robots to be made aware of information, resulting in extended synchronization.  Sometimes referred to as the hive mind, this architecture will not only be able to process disparate data, but also be able to store huge amounts of information, securely and in an organized way. As such, certain key robotic functions could be made available as a service on-demand. These on-demand robotic functions will drive more and more advanced robotic processing capability.  Just as humans try to work together in teams, robots generally also need figure out how to operate in tandem. Questions that arise include how robots will communicate with the brain in the first place, and how they will then translate that intelligence to other robots and their human counterparts. This communication will require some kind of mediator. However, not all companies seeking to implement robotics solutions have a firm understanding of these underlying challenges.  Today, businesses in every industry around the world are demonstrating that robotics is more than just hype. Your company could be the next to unlock new profitable business models, foster innovation and create amazing new experiences for your customersas long as you approach robotic applications with an open mind and a clear understanding of its potential for your business!  All these and more will be discussed at the upcoming inaugural edition of the Singapore International Robo Expo, a conference and exhibition co-organised by the Singapore Industrial Automation Association (SIAA) and Experia Events. The event will be held from November 1-2, 2016, at the Marina Bay Sands Convention and Exhibition Centre in Singapore.     Mr Oliver Tian is the president of SIAA and the CEO and director of HutCabb Services. SIAA drives Automation, IoT, and Robotics (AIR), with robotics as one of the key pillars in our charter. The association has embarked on this robotic journey to bring automation to a different level and we believe the assimilation of man and machine functions can be a potent force to be reckoned with.

26,"Standing at just 1.4m, Hospi, Changi General Hospital's (CGH) newest porter, still gets the occasional stare as it moves along the building's corridors.  That is because it is not human. It has a computer screen for a face, and a cold, hard, white body to match.  But it can move almost as well as a person, with the ability to avoid obstacles, take the lift and move from room to room to deliver items without supervision, and has, since last year, taken on some of the work of porters at the hospital.  CGH is not alone in turning to intelligent mechanical helpers. Over at the National University Hospital, a robotic system automatically picks up and packs medicine at its pharmacy, even keeping track of expiry dates.  Healthcare is a notoriously labour-intensive affair, where ferrying a single bed-bound patient to get an X-ray requires the combined effort of two hospital staff. Each day hundreds of trips are also taken on foot to deliver medicine, medical samples and reports across hospital floors.  It is against this backdrop that doctors and scientists alike started dreaming up ideas of robotic employees some 10 years ago - visions that are starting to take shape today.  These intelligent machines are only going to get closer to patients, eventually even helping to lift them off their beds, says Nanyang Technological University (NTU) don Ang Wei Tech.     Above: Microbiological testing laboratory Ugene Laboratory Services invested in a $1.5 million robot to do routine tasks like weighing samples and to conduct simple tests for bacteria like E. coli. PHOTOS: LIM SIN THAI, MARCUS TAN, AZIZ HUSSIN FOR THE STRAITS TIMES     Associate Professor Ang, who is associate chair of research at the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, said such a robot is still a few years away, but he has his sights set on creating one that can move three patients on their hospital beds at once, with just one person to supervise it.  The university is one of many academic institutions, companies and start-ups worldwide that are trying to gain a foothold in the multibillion-dollar robotics industry. And healthcare is just one sector that robotics has infiltrated.  The industry is exploding and disrupting life as we know it.  CHEAPER AND SMARTER    Robots first made their mark in the manufacturing industry in the 1970s, taking on mundane and repetitive tasks such as assembling different machine parts - all done in the confines of cages built specially for them in factories.     Above: A robotic arm in NUH automatically picking up and packing medicine at the pharmacy. The machine is part of the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation System that went live in November 2014. . PHOTOS: LIM SIN THAI, MARCUS TAN, AZIZ HUSSIN FOR THE STRAITS TIMES     But in recent years they have morphed into the collaborative robots or ""co-bots"" that work alongside humans, equipped with better sensing capabilities for safety and higher levels of artificial intelligence, and now have ventured out of their cages and factories.  Experts attribute this to advancements in mobile computing technology that have driven down the cost of micro-controllers - essentially computers on a chip that give robots their artificial intelligence - from $10,000 a decade ago to about $200 today.  The cost of force control sensors that tell the robot to stop when it makes contact with an obstacle - for example, a human arm - has also fallen from over $10,000 to around $1,000 over the same period, said Prof Ang.     Above: A CGH nurse collecting documents delivered by Hospi, which takes on the work of porters. .PHOTOS: LIM SIN THAI, MARCUS TAN, AZIZ HUSSIN FOR THE STRAITS TIMES     Hence it is now possible for a typical robot with six axes - meaning it can move six different ways - to have a micro-controller and a force sensor at each joint. This makes it far more sensitive to human touch and, hence, safer.  These days robots cut across various sectors, including healthcare, transport, security, logistics and manufacturing - creating an industry that is taking shape as the centrepiece of the next industrial revolution.  The global robotics industry is expected to grow from US$20 billion (S$27 billion) to US$80 billion by 2025, according to the International Federation Report on Robotics Statistical Analysis and EU Roadmap 2013.  Last year, over 240,000 industrial robots were sold - a 12 per cent increase from the year before, with China leading the pack with 68,000 units sold in the country. The International Federation of Robotics has predicted that some 2.3 million units will be deployed on factory floors by 2018 - more than twice as many as in 2009.  But some human workers have paid a high price for the growth of robots. For example, Chinese company Foxconn Technology Group, which supplies electronics to Apple and Samsung, replaced 60,000 employees in its factories with robots.  Research agency Gartner predicts that by 2018 more than three million workers globally will be supervised by ""robobosses"" with the ability to evaluate an employee's performance solely on quantifiable data, such as the angle at which a waiter presents a plate or how quickly he smiles, and without bias. It adds that half of the fastest-growing firms will have fewer employees than smart machines.  However, job losses are much less of a problem for a country like Singapore, where manpower is in short supply, experts said. Dr Satish Lele, senior vice-president of automation and electronics at research agency Frost and Sullivan, Asia-Pacific, said questions about jobs being replaced are usually asked in developing countries that have an abundance of labour, but ""here, robots could be integral in creating the right balance between Singaporeans and foreign labour"".  The Economic Development Board (EDB) said robotics technology could be a way for the city-state - faced with an ageing population, slow population growth and political pressure to limit the inflow of foreign workers - to ""boost productivity amid a tight labour market"".  Besides enabling the continued employment of an ageing workforce through automation of production tasks, robotics allows manufacturing to be done at higher precision, quality, speed and consistency. It also enables tasks to be carried out in areas that are inaccessible to human workers, such as high-temperature and high-pressure environments, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  While industrial robots still make up the bulk of all robots deployed worldwide, experts said service robots are likely to be a greater force here. They expect to see many more service robots in the next five years, especially in the healthcare, food and beverage, and hospitality sectors, where labour is hardest to come by.  More robots will take on logistics tasks at hospitals, like the ones at CGH. Others will become waiters, like the robots Lucy and Mary at Rong Heng Seafood restaurant at the East Coast Seafood Centre. They can deliver food to any of the 29 tables on the ground floor of the restaurant in two minutes.  Four-year-old robotics start-up Techmetics has also invented a robot named Techi that can do the job of three hotel staff.  Two have been deployed at Park Avenue Rochester Hotel in Buona Vista, and have taken on the role of housekeeping aides, delivering bottled water, linen and toiletries to hotel rooms. They will be used later to deliver food, luggage and mail to guests' rooms.  Techmetics chief executive Mathan Muthupillai said four more such robots will make their debut at Singapore restaurants, including IndoChine and Kinsa Sushi, in two months, helping to serve food to patrons and clear their dishes.  Without the need for lunch, tea or dinner breaks, and with no ability to fall sick or become tired, robots can be at any employer's beck and call 24/7, said Mr Mathan.  PLAYING CATCH-UP    Right now, Singapore has some catching up to do with other countries because it started to adopt robots rather ""late in the game"", said Professor Tan Sze Wee, who is the executive director of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's Science and Engineering Research Council.  One reason for this, he said, was that ""until recently, manufacturing has largely been driven by labour growth rather than productivity growth, due to having a much younger workforce"".  Prof Ang, agreeing with Prof Tan, said Singapore was too cautious when robotics started to take off back in 2011, when the components needed to build them became cheaper. He and his colleagues approached the Government with proposals for robotics research and funds needed for it, but were turned down.  But in 2014, the Government turned to the NTU team instead for input on a national robotics programme. The same year, Google acquired eight robotics companies.  Still, Prof Ang said he believes that while Singapore lagged behind in adopting robot technology, the Republic is, in fact, on a par with other countries when it comes to robotics innovation.  ""The lack of funding over the last five years made it difficult for robotics technologies developed here to leave the laboratory and move into the market,"" he said. But he added that the tide can turn with the generous funding that the Government is now promising.  To catch up and even jump ahead, the Government announced a $450 million National Robotics Programme during the Budget debate in April this year, to drive the development, test-bedding and deployment of robotics technology in both public and private sectors.  An additional $400 million will also be made available to local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are keen to automate.  The EDB now sees huge potential in this field. ""Given the global growth potential of new-generation collaborative and service robots, with the right strategy, we see opportunities to nurture robotics into potentially a billion-dollar industry in the next five to 10 years,"" an EDB spokesman said.  That could in turn provide between 2,000 and 3,000 good job opportunities for engineers here, she added.  The Government has set its sights on these sectors: healthcare, transport, security, environment, logistics and manufacturing.  The strategy is to spur innovation in the public and private sectors while concurrently encouraging and supporting the adoption of market- ready robotics technology across manufacturing and services sectors among large, medium-sized and small businesses alike, the EDB said.  Singapore is not without success stories. Semiconductor maker Globalfoundries Singapore, for example, introduced intelligent systems to its factories in 2010 and now has 42 autonomous mobile robots to move materials in its manufacturing line. That has improved labour productivity by 25 per cent.  Researchers at NTU last year unveiled Nadine, a humanoid robot that can answer questions posed to it, remember past conversations and even gauge how a person is feeling by reading facial gestures.  Mr Charlie Ill, investment director at venture capital firm Red Dot Ventures, said the number of robotics start-ups that have come knocking on his door has gone up from just one last year to seven so far this year. The challenge for these start-ups, said Mr Ill, would be to differentiate themselves from the competition, in terms of cost and by providing a suite of software solutions that allows the robot to work independently with minimal human interaction.  ROBOTICS SAVVY    In the future, robots will greet customers at retail stores and give suggestions based on past purchases. They will front restaurants, take orders as patrons queue and help cut waiting times.  In healthcare, they will improve treatment precision in surgery, for example. At home, they will help caregivers and support independent living with assistive technology, said CGH chief executive Lee Chien Earn.  They will also help reshape experiences and business processes. They will create jobs that never existed, and change the concept of what types of jobs are suitable for humans.  ""Through strategic deployment"", the EDB said, ""advanced robotics can potentially help free up resources, enabling our workforce to take on higher-value, more productive jobs"".  Robotics manpower talent will be required at all levels, it added, from operators who can program and work comfortably with robots to engineers and scientists who can design and build the next generation of robots, as well as those who can contribute to research and development.  Also needed are cyber-security teams that can prevent robots from getting hacked, said market analyst Bob Gill from ARC Advisory Group.  To ensure robotics really takes flight here, more thought has to be put into how to retrain workers for new jobs, and to create a new generation of workers who are not just tech-savvy but ""robotics-savvy"", said Prof Tan. ""We need to think about how we train them at schools, at universities, and to get kids interested in robots,"" he added.  As a start, IDA has launched the Robotics and Maker Academy to teach primary and secondary school students to code and program robots. Since 2014, more than 10,000 students have gone through the programme.  The agency also launched the Code@SG movement in 2014, which includes the National Infocomm Competition that allows students to pit their skills in areas like robotics, security, data analytics and coding.  An Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore spokesman said the aim is for young Singaporeans to become confident with coding and robotics technology to help prepare them for a Smart Nation future.  At the end of the day, acceptance is key, said Prof Tan. ""Over time, we have to understand that we should adopt and embrace robots, and to use them as naturally as we use Facebook or e-mail.""",2016-07-08,"The Economic Development Board (EDB) said robotics technology could ...

27,"76-year-old Mr Tan is at the doctors for his backache. While he waits for his appointment, a robot trundles up and asks for his symptoms. Later, the doctor prescribes a mobile app with exercises.  This could well be the future of healthcare in Singapore. Its national health robotics lab  Centre for Healthcare Assistive and Robotics Technology at Changi General Hospital  is researching and testing new ways to deliver care and improve staffs productivity.  GovInsider spoke with Selina Seah, the centres director and Assistant Chief Executive of Changi General Hospital, to find out what lies ahead.      Smart hospitals  Singapores ageing population is leading to more complex diseases, people living longer and fewer caregivers  what Seah calls a triple tsunami. The government plans to build smart hospitals to deal with this onslaught using robotics.  Changi General Hospital has started by automating logistics. Transport robots have been working in the hospital since last year, moving documents, drugs, specimens and linen. They navigate obstacles on their own, and are linked with the hospitals fire alarm system for emergencies. The hospital next plans to use robots to move heavier objects, like patient beds.  It is also researching roles for robots to interact directly with people. We are looking at robots to be the interface between humans, she says. For instance, robots could get information from patients while they wait to see a doctor.  A third area for robots is in precision medicine. The hospital is researching whether robots can be used for surgeries and rehabilitation. They can help in making sure that the treatment is consistent and precise, far more than a human, says Seah. Robots would be able to pinpoint the exact location of tumours, for instance, and do less damage doing surgeries.  The hospital is researching whether mobile apps can be used for treatments. We are look at working with certain researchers and also industry players, she says.  Chronic diseases are on the rise, and their treatment involves lifestyle changes. For instance, drugs only do half the work for diabetes, Seah says. Patients must also exercise and watch their diet. How do we prescribe that part and ensure that can be complied to  Mobile apps can help by gamifying healthcare, she says. Apps can track their performance and use the data to motivate patients to change their behaviour. People challenge themselves if there is a goal to be challenged on, Seah says.  Singapore is not the only one looking at health apps. The US Food and Drug Administration is looking at certified mobile health apps, Seah says, while South Korea and European countries are fighting to enter.  Such apps are yet to be clinically trialled, however. They must be tested to ensure that patients recover faster. Its no different from the rigour one needs to go through for drugs, she says.  Even with new treatments, every person reacts uniquely to exercise, drugs and food. Doctors have to try various combinations to find out what works best for each patient. When the trials dont work and diseases get more complicated, it becomes a huge burden to the whole society. This is the problem here for us in Singapore, she says.  Singapore is looking at how it can use personalised treatments to prevent complications. Its a five-year research programme which has just started, Seah says, targeting diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular diseases.  The country has already taken the first step towards it. It has built a national electronic health records system. It is now looking to build predictive algorithms that can analyse data, like blood sugar readings, and recommend personalised treatments. This would be able to alert individuals and hospitals before people fall seriously ill.  The vision for smart hospitals could become a reality in three to five years, she says. A few things that will need to change to make way, however.  Robots will take over some jobs, people will need to be retrained. We foresee the need to transform the workforce in the next five to ten years, Seah says.  Security will have to be improved with the increased use of data analytics. Some mobile health technologies are still hackable, she says. Singapore will need to be a step ahead on cyber security issues.  A third challenge is coordination across government. There are many personal views about robotics, she says, and even more about health robots. Getting all the stakeholders to agree on funding priorities has been a rather long engagement. The health robotics lab plays a crucial role in bringing all the stakeholders on the same page.

32,"A spider-like reconnaissance robot and a rounded toilet bowl devoid of crevices are two of 36 projects that have been awarded the Singapore Good Design Mark this year.  Launched by the Design Business Chamber Singapore (DBCS) in 2013, the mark aims to recognise well- designed products and services. So far, 176 projects have received the award.  While this year's showing is smaller than last year's, when there were 45 winners, DBCS president Tai Lee Siang notes that the quality of projects has improved.  ""I see higher standards of design. There's been stiff competition in the last two years and people have to work harder to get to where they are,"" says Mr Tai, who attributes the smaller pool of entries to the economic slowdown.  Entries are judged according to six criteria, including sustainability, which means that projects had to minimise their environmental footprint.  The mark aims to show the public what good design is and that the concept of design is beyond aesthetics, says Mr Tai. ""People still have a very narrow definition of design. They think that design is about interior or aesthetic design, but everything that you can see, touch and feel has an element of design.""  Here are five winning works.  Inspired by paddy fields around South-east Asia, this Housing Board project features a terraced design, providing inhabitants with panoramic views of the nearby Punggol Waterway.  It is the first HDB project near a waterway to have a rain garden on the circumference of the blocks, which helps filter and purify rainwater before it enters the waterway.  With solar panels installed on the taller buildings, the HDB blocks are self-sustainable in energy as the solar panels alone can power the lighting of the project's public areas, such as the void decks and corridors.  This project was designed by architecture firms Aedas and Group8asia. The design will inspire other similar housing developments along waterways, says HDB's deputy director of design implementation, Mr Quek Ser Bock, 50.  When faced with hazy conditions, many will choose to take a break from exercising outdoors.  However, when faced with that problem in China, Airmotion Laboratories' founder chose instead to come up with this face- mask solution.  Fitted with a PM2.5 filter, which is able to keep out the smallest polluting particles in the air, the mask comes with a tiny built-in fan that allows more air to pass through the replaceable filter.  This allows the user to breathe in more air at a go, says its designer Leonard Tan Bahroocha, 41, who developed the product with the maskmaking company's founder Bibi Ho, 46.  The mask is designed to fit the user's face securely to ensure that no polluted air is let in. Other user- friendly features include adjustable straps that go round the back of the neck instead of at the ears, so it does not interfere with eyewear.  The mask is available at www.falconpev.com.sg and retails at $98, but is now out of stock.  3 SCORPIO URBAN RECONNAISSANCE ROBOT BY SINGAPORE UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN  This invention seems to have come out of a science-fiction novel as the spider-shaped robot is the first of its kind to be able to crawl, climb walls and roll.  Specially designed for urban reconnaissance missions, the 12cmtall robot is capable of taking photographs and mapping out areas in 2D.  Created by a team from the Singapore University of Technology and Design, the robot will help ensure the safety of its security personnel.  The design was inspired by an endangered spider species, says the project's head researcher, Dr Mohan Rajesh Elara, 34.  ""We looked to nature to extract design principles,"" he says, adding that the robot's rolling feature was inspired by the spider's ability to roll down surfaces with minimal effort.  Despite the complexity of its design, the robot can be operated easily through a mobile application, he says.  For more information, go to temasek-labs.sutd.edu.sg  Unlike bulky, kiosk-like health monitoring stations used by healthcare providers, this portable health monitor was designed with ease of use in mind.  Measuring about 30cm in height, the device can be easily deployed by healthcare personnel and be used to monitor a user's key vital signs, such as blood pressure and weight. This data can then be transmitted to a community nurse through the device's software.  To use the device, a user taps his identity card at the side and the screen will display his health profile. The device also has Bluetooth capabilities, enabling it to work with other measuring devices.  ""Even though the functionalities aren't novel, by bringing them together in such a cohesive package, the Mobile Health Monitor stands out as the first of its kind,"" says the project's lead designer Nigel Geh, 27.  While this rounded toilet bowl - which has fewer crevices on its exterior that could trap dirt - might look simple, it had to be carefully designed to retain its functionality.  For example, it allows users to sit on it comfortably without their calves touching the bottom of the toilet bowl, says its lead designer Tan Boon Han, 29.  The toilet bowl boasts an anti- bacterial coating and is 25 per cent more water-efficient than a regular one, using a maximum of 4.5 litres for a full flush.

33,"As technological advancements continue to impact societies, businesses and citizens in Singapore must prepare for jobs to be affected and learn to use new digital tools more effectively.  The government itself would need to ensure its employees could do the same, said Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister-in-Charge of Smart Nation Vivian Balakrishnan. He revealed that the Singapore government's CIO agency GovTech today signed an agreement with the National University of Singapore (NUS) to jointly develop processes and ways to boost cybersecurity in the public sector.  The university also would provide training for 10,000 public servants in data science over five years, said Balakrishnan during his keynote Wednesday at the IoT Asia 2017 conference.  Noting the role of Apple iPhone in driving the smartphone market over just a decade since its debut, the Singapore minister said the volume of mobile internet traffic also had rapidly increased since 2007 when it was measured in petabytes. Today, online traffic from mobile devices was measured in exabytes, clocking 7.2 exabytes a month at end-2016 compared to just 15 petabytes in 2007.  He also recalled how he talked about Boston Dynamics' Atlas robot at the same conference last year, which was able to open glass doors and regain its footing after slipping. Today, Atlas was able to rollerblade and jump over obstacles.  The vast improvements in languages, game playing, and agility, amongst others, within one year demonstrated the pace of learning and skills acquisition of robots far exceeded that of humans, he said.  Jobs would be disrupted and middle-class white-collar work as well as wages would be impacted, Balakrishnan said, noting that this was a real-world challenge that politicians anywhere in the world could not ignore.  He added that it would be ""far too simplistic and populist"" to use walls and barriers as a prescription, likening such efforts as using anaesthesia to numb the pain. Instead, he stressed the need to help businesses and employees adapt to the digital revolution.  ""People, companies, and nations that master technology first will have enormous reach because their market is global. Our challenge is to democratise these new technologies so as to empower all our citizens to harvest the opportunities more broadly,"" he said, adding that this, in turn, would generate jobs.  GovTech's collaboration with NUS, for instance, would develop the necessary syllabus to help public servants better use data and digital tools, he noted. This would improve government services and the way performance was measured. He also urged local companies and employees to determine if their skills were updated and ready to ride the digital revolution.  Balakrishnan also pointed to the Singapore government's various smart nation initiatives, which focused on tapping digital technologies to improve efficiencies and service delivery. Such efforts included the development of a national IoT (Internet of Things) and sensor communication backbone, also dubbed the Smart Nation Platform. This network would facilitate the sharing of data sensors rolled out by government agencies such as lamp posts, which would be tested as nodes for deploying sensors, beacons, and connectivity.  The minister added that four banks--DBS, OCBC, UOB, and Standard Chartered Bank--currently were part of a pilot to access personal information via the Singapore government's MyInfo portal, which enabled citizens to provide their data that then could be used for electronic transactions. In the trial, for instance, citizens could log into their SingPass account so their personal data could be passed on to the bank to facilitate the opening of an account.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) also was putting in place plans to deploy a Central Addressing Scheme this year to facilitate digital cash transfers. This would enable mobile phone numbers or business unique entity numbers to be linked to bank accounts, so funds could be transferred without the need to give out bank account details. In addition, MAS was working to introduce a Unified Point of Sale terminal at checkout counters to eliminate the need for different POS terminals and simplify payment platforms for retailers.  The government was keen to encourage the use of electronic payments with such initiatives, Balakrishnan said, noting the current lack of incentive to move to a cashless environment because other payment modes including cash and credit worked so well in the country.  Charles Reed Anderson, founder of Charles Reed Anderson & Associates, also lauded the Singapore government's recent move to reorganise its organisational structure to finetune its focus on smart nation.  This had led to the creation of a new Smart Nation and Digital Government (SNDG) Group, parked under the Prime Minister's Office, to enable the government to be ""more integrated and responsive"". The new unit would comprise employees from three existing government departments including the Ministry of Finance's Digital Government Directorate and the Ministry of Communications and Information's Government Technology Policy department.  Speaking during his keynote at IoT Asia, Anderson said internal collaboration and coordinated efforts were key to successful implementations of IoT and smart city projects. This also would provide a common platform for data sharing, which was critical in IoT-driven initiatives.  Balakrishnan said: ""Collectively, the SNDG group will tighten linkages between planning and implementation, and allow us to be more agile in driving digital government and building Singapore as a smart nation.  Citizens, too, needed to be consulted early, said John Baekelmans, managing director and vice president of Belgium-based research institute IMEC, which specialised in nanotechnology and digital technologies. The company currently was helping the Belgium city of Antwerp with its smart city initiative, officially launched in January this year.  ""You need to work around a quadruple helix setup--comprising citizens, private companies, research organisations, and the public sector--where typically the citizen centric approach is the most important to consider [but] typically forgotten in a smart city environment,"" said Baekelmans, who was a speaker at the conference. ""One lesson we learnt is that citizens have to be consulted early. Trials can then be run based on the problems they want to solve.""  From there, data collected through IoT sensors could provide policy planners a picture of how to address the problems, he told ZDNet, adding that more datasets could be further collected to assess if improvements had been made.  ""It is crucial that citizens believe in a project [and] that their lives will be improved by it,"" he said. Putting in place the right customer panels for smart city applications and securing customer buy-in proved most challenging, he said, adding that once these use-cases were established, the rest would fall in place. He noted that technology selection should be the last piece of the puzzle, not the key driver of smart city projects.  ""Many smart city projects are top-down driven because you need the government to be able to effect changes to infrastructure. However, this also means that sometimes citizens are not consulted early enough and their needs not reflected,"" Baekelmans explained. ""Having that focus on citizens makes it more likely they will take up your digital service.""  He added that it remained challenging to seamlessly connect the different technologies since not all were open or based on industry standards. Security and privacy also were key considerations across any smart city framework, which meant IT vendors sometimes would have to be pushed to ensure compliance.  To better drive its smart nation trials forward, he suggested Singapore worked with its citizens in a ""living lab"" model and prepared to accept failure in order to understand why some technologies were rejected and learn from that. For instance, projects could fail because citizens felt the services were unnecessary or intruded on their privacy.  Balakrishnan also stressed the importance of cybersecurity, which he said was a key prerequisite of Singapore's smart nation efforts. ""Critical control systems must be protected even as we make them smart. We must ensure our digital identity framework and e-transactions are secure and robust,"" he said, adding that the government would continue to work with industry players and experts on this.  He also pointed to GovTech's collaboration with NUS, which would include establishing methods to bolster cybersecurity for government agencies.  Through such efforts and its smart nation initiatives, the Singapore government hoped to ensure the country was ready to embrace market changes ""from a position of strength"".  ""There is a digital revolution that is disrupting jobs and having a major impact on wages,"" the minister said. ""The [global] political disquiet is reflective of a revolution and the real choice for governments worldwide is whether you try to insulate, build walls, and avoid facing the reality of this revolution; or take the opposite approach to be open and prepare your people with the relevant skills and abilities so we can ride and surf the waves of this revolution.""",2017-03-29,"As technological advancements continue to impact societies, ...

36,"New buildings in Singapore may soon be inspected by a high-tech robot armed with laser scanners and cameras capable of spotting the tiniest cracks and defects.  SINGAPORE: New buildings in Singapore may soon be inspected by a high-tech robot armed with laser scanners and cameras capable of spotting the tiniest cracks and defects.  Named the ""Quality Inspection and Assessment Robot"" - or QuicaBot, it was invented by scientists from Nanyang Technological University, and co-developed with Singapores national industrial developer JTC and local start-up CtrlWorks for over a year.  The robot can move autonomously to scan a room in minutes, using an array of sensors and cameras that include:  1) A small laser scanner for navigation and mapping;  2) A large laser scanner to inspect walls' evenness and squareness;  3) An Inclinometer to check the evenness of the floor;  4) A thermal infrared camera to check for hollowness in tiles;  5) A small standard colour camera to detect cracks on walls.  Developers say their solution is more accurate, reliable and consistent than a fully manual inspection done by human inspectors with measurement tools like a spirit level and set square. For instance, inspections typically done by sampling points might miss possible errors which will not be overlooked by the robot as it can scan the entire space., according to its developers. Neither will the robots tire across the 36 hours of operation time they get on a single 2 hour charge.  Several of these robots could also work together, uploading 3D data of the scans to the cloud for a human operator to inspect critical and complex defects. They could also handle much of the routine, tedious inspection work and free up human inspectors to focus on areas that require more expertise and judgement to examine.  The key aim is to automate and speed up the building inspection process according to standards set by the Building and Construction Authority, said Project Leader from Nanyang Technological University's School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Assistant Prof Erdal Kayacan.  ""Visual inspection of a new building is an intensive effort that takes two inspectors, so we have designed a robot to assist a human inspector to do his job in about half the time, saving precious time and manpower,"" said Asst Prof Kayacan.    Having cleared small-scale lab testing, QuicaBot will be test-bedded at suitable locations within JTCs industrial developments like JTC Space @ Gul in the first quarter of 2017. Success there could see further scaling up to other projects and commercialisation.",2016-09-20,New buildings in Singapore may soon be inspected by a high-tech robot armed with laser scanners and cameras capable of spotting the tiniest ...,Robotic inspector to speed up building checks,http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/robotic-inspector-to-speed-up-building-checks/3144064.html
38,"Its a weekend, but these children are back at school.  Theyre not brooding over the extra class: in fact, quite the opposite. Theyre happily queuing up in a makeshift supermarket, smiling and bobbling about. Why is this exercise so fun for them The cashier happens to be a robot.  This is all part of a new scheme to prepare young Singaporean pre-schoolers for the future. The technology assists them with social development, and prepares them for a world of digital assistants and robotic colleagues. In five to 10 years, they might see a robot in the checkout counter, notes Adrian Lim, director of education at the Infocomm Media Development Authority.  IMDA is leading this new pilot project in partnership with the Softbank robotics company and Nanyang Technological University. GovInsider spoke with the key players to find out more.  Two Singaporean preschools have been trialling out Softbank robots since June. Two humanoid assistants  Pepper and Nao  teach geography, emotional skills, and recycling, amongst other lesson plans. For example, in one class a robot listens to a teacher read a story and gives emotional responses according to the plotline. Each trial class comprises roughly 12 to 16 students.  Why start in preschools Children aged five to six have underdeveloped cognitive capabilities, explains Chen I-Ming, Director of the Intelligent Systems Centre at NTU. At this younger age, I think its a good time to shape them. Once children are older than 10, they are less intrigued by robots.  This is, in fact, Lims second pilot using robots in Singaporean preschools. Last year, he launched the Playmaker scheme, where children used educational toys to learn vocabulary, logic, sequencing and navigation with educational toys. Robots assisted with the basics of the curriculum.  Now, he says, we have gone beyond introducing toy robots. This trial uses more advanced equipment for a broader range of tasks. Were interested in seeing how robots can support the teaching and learning process in the classroom.  How is Singapore doing this  Lims team approached the pilot methodically. First, they had teachers read books to the classes explaining to them what robots are. When you introduce any new technology, you cant just put the tech into the classroom without preparing the ground, Lim says. I dont think you can assume that kids know everything about robots, so it lies on the teachers to educate them.  Equally, teachers had to be given some technical understanding, and were consulted on potential lesson plans. At any point before the lessons were rolled out, everybody gave their input, Lim says.  Meanwhile, NTU provided academic expertise and looked to see how the two humanoid robots could be used appropriately. In each specific lesson, we utilised different robot capabilities, explains Chen. The reason why we can keep the kids excited, because everytime they see the robots, they can do something different, he adds.  There have been mixed results in the past five months. The teachers felt that robots in the classroom were a useful addition: There was higher retention, and a lot of kids look forward to coming to school, he says.  However, success is very much dependent on discipline in the classroom. Every child wants to rush toward the robot and touch it, he says. Teachers have to manage that instinct and ensure the class does not get overexcited.  Teachers should also have some technical understanding, he says. This indicates the future skills needed in the education profession. You need the teacher to be able to manage on the ground if the robot malfunctions. Lim recalls an instance when Peppers battery ran out: the teacher successfully turned it into a lesson on electricity and batteries.  The tech does currently have its flaws. For example, the robots only have a battery life span of 30 minutes  just enough to cover a class, Chen says; and it cannot recognise your voice in very noisy environments.  But for Lim and his colleagues, this pilot project is just the tip of the iceberg. Moving forward, you have really got to bring everybody together  the teachers and the industry players with the best tech, he says. Robots fascinate children, and they can provide support to teachers on a vital area of cognitive development.  Will the scheme soon be adapted by the masses Currently we are studying the findings, Lim says, consulting both NTU and Softbank on the best move forward. We think there is scope for us to deploy this to more pre-schools.  One characteristic of a Smart Nation might be the younger generation flocking to schools just to meet their robot classmate. After all, one day a robot could be their future colleague too.",2016-11-15,The cashier happens to be a robot.

39,"An innovative robotic system that can clean building exteriors using water jets or give new coats of paint is now ready to serve customers in Singapore.  It is co-developed by local pioneer in automated controls and biometric contactless systems ELID Technology International and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), ranked 4th globally for Engineering & Technology in the recent Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings by Subject 2017.  Named OutoBot, this patent-pending automation is locally built and will improve productivity while enhancing workplace safety. It needs only half the manpower to run and can work for longer hours as compared to manual methods.  For the washing or painting of a building faade, a team of five is usually required - two on the ground and roof top, with three cleaners or painters on the gondola.  Instead, Outobot requires only two workers - one operator on the ground and one as a safety officer.  It has a robotic arm equipped with a camera and a spray nozzle that can shoot high-pressure water jets to clean surfaces or to spray paint. No painters or cleaners are required to be on the system's specially built gondola.  ELID's first innovation in robotic automation was envisaged in response to the Housing & Development Board (HDB) call for proposals to automate the painting of external HDB building faades, so as to enhance worker safety and increase productivity.  Managing Director of ELID Technology International, Mr Dennis Lim, who first came up with an idea of the robotic system, said it would tackle productivity issues for painting buildings in line with Singapore's Smart Nation vision.  ""With Singapore's rapidly aging workforce, we need to find ways to enable our employees to continue contributing despite their advanced years,"" Mr Lim explained.  ""Using our new robot, we have shown that a labour-intensive job can transformed into one that can be easily done by an older worker, and at the same time eliminating the risk of employees having to work at heights,"" added Mr Lim.  Professor Chen I-Ming, Director of the NTU Robotic Research Centre who jointly led the development of OutoBot, said the project is an example of how the university leverages its engineering expertise to improve productivity, while enhancing worker safety.  ""Our aim is to make the cleaning and painting of high-rise buildings easier, safer and more cost-effective,"" explained Prof Chen, who teaches at NTU's School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. ""By using spray painting over conventional roller painting, our robot is also more precise and efficient, minimising waste and saving paint.""  ""To tackle Singapore's manpower challenges, NTU has a strong research focus on robotics, which is set to fill an important gap in the productivity and automation needs of the industry. We can now do more with less manpower.""  OutoBot comprises of a robotic arm with six-degrees of freedom mounted on a specially designed automated gondola and weighs under 500 kilogrammes.  Powered by a conventional power outlet, the robot can scan the exterior surface of a building using a camera and automatically plot the areas to spray paint or clean while avoiding the windows. It also gives a more consistent coat of paint as compared to the manual methods.  Apart from saving up to 50 per cent manpower requirements, it can speed up both the cleaning and painting process by about 30 per cent since it does not need a break. The automated system also minimises wastage, saving up to 20 per cent of paint.  To speed up the process at the same building, multiple systems can be deployed.  Next phase: Trials in industrial and residential areas  The made-in-Singapore OutoBot is now patent pending and has been put through its paces at an industrial building located at Ubi, in the eastern part of Singapore. It is now ready and will be deployed for an upcoming project over the next few months. It will also be tested on selected public housing blocks, in consultation with HDB. Through the trials, HDB will work with ELID to refine or customise the robot's design to better suit its building designs and facades.  ELID, together with NTU's innovation and enterprise arm NTUitive, are now in talks with other companies as well as government agencies to deploy the robot at other suitable commercial and residential properties.  A research-intensive public university, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) has 33,500 undergraduate and postgraduate students in the colleges of Engineering, Business, Science, Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences, and its Interdisciplinary Graduate School. It also has a medical school, the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, set up jointly with Imperial College London.  NTU is also home to world-class autonomous institutes - the National Institute of Education, S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, Earth Observatory of Singapore, and Singapore Centre for Environmental Life Sciences Engineering - and various leading research centres such as the Nanyang Environment & Water Research Institute (NEWRI), Energy Research Institute @ NTU (ERI@N) and the Institute on Asian Consumer Insight (ACI).

40,"Traditionally, robots sit in the factory within a finite space and with fixed rules, a safe distance away from its human operators. Today, the capabilities of robots have grown and humans and robots can almost work hand in hand. This may have resulted in the fear of robots for taking over jobs or the loss of the ""human touch"".  Against the backdrop of the tightening labour market and rising manpower costs, adopting robotic technology could potentially boost productivity, in addition to strengthening competitiveness and generating growth, whilst retaining staff employment. Studies have shown that robotics and automation have made a positive net effect on labour demand in the Europe and United States regions1.  Robotics has been identified as a growth sector in the international marketplace. Having a headstart in building competitive and differentiated robotics ecosystem may prove to be beneficial. According to the International Federation of Robotics Statistical Analysis and EU Roadmap 2013, the global robotics industry is projected to grow from US$20b today to US$80b by 2025.  China, already the global leader in the robotics sales market, will continue their quest at adopting robotics, targetting to achieve a robot density of 150 units by 2020. The Republic of Korea and Japan are hot on the heels of China2. Japan, already a known robotics powerhouse, has plans to triple its spending on intelligent machines to 2.4t yen by 20203. Robotics is also one of the pillars of Singapores future economy, with strong government support in the form of the National Robotics Programme.  The path to adopting robotics  starting with cobotisation   The path to adopting robotics has to be a well-planned one, and a good starting point would be to redesign work spaces to allow for an inclusive workplace where humans and robots can work together in a collaborative and mutually reinforcing way  cobotisation.  It is possible for a degree of artificial intelligence, perhaps a form of ambient intelligence, in robotic technologies to create effective engagements between man and machine. With the current advancements in sensor technology, visual analytics, and machine learning, robots are emerging as a viable working mate in both traditional settings and for new applications across industries.  At Tung Lok Group, it takes only two chefs to operate a cooking robot that can prepare up to 60kg of food. Smarter robotic arms are being developed to ensure safety and to minimise errors and wastage, monitored by technically-savvy human controllers. Small business owners such as toys and jewellery makers can also save time by automating some of their processes with automated 3D printers. The possibilities of robotics assisting humans are endless.  Getting ready for the change   Like any form of transformation, stakeholders would have to understand the business' stance and embrace the shift towards cobotisation. Business owners, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), must take the first step in understanding how robotics technologies can help their business stay competitive and look into the potential funding opportunities to ease them into the path of robotic technology adoption.  Small businesses can also participate in incubator programmes or training workshops established by industry leaders. ABB's Regional Robotics Packaging Application Hub features demo units to allow customers, partners, and ABB to run trials with actual products, assemble robotics systems, and run tests. Such innovation platforms benefit the emerging companies and are good best practices that could be adopted to fit their needs.  Before taking the plunge into the drive for robotics and automation, employers should start redesigning jobs and equip employees with new skills to prepare them for the shift towards cobotisation. They could also tap on funding and re-skilling opportunities available through the government or industry associations. In Singapore, we have the National Robotics Programme, which pledged $450m to help companies apply robotics and automation solutions.  Industry support is key   The transformation of the business should also be supported by the government agencies and industry associations.  Organisations such as SPRING Singapore has already taken steps to encourage more enterprises to adopt digital and automation solutions with its recently launched industry-specific roadmap. By partnering the Workforce Singapore to re-skill labour, the agencies will ensure a holistic transition, starting with the food services and retail industry.  The success of the first VendCaf, a food vending machine, is a prime example of the possibility of shifting towards robotics and automation. It not only requires 70% to 90% less manpower, but is also available 24/7 to consumers. There are already plans to launch more of such machines around the country.  1Study of Mannheim Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) and the University of Utrecht, 2016; and World Robotics Report 2016.

42,"SINGAPORE - Drivers headed to the Central Business District may have a robot as their next valet. By the end of the next year (2018), the redeveloped Robinson Towers will feature a new automated system that makes use of robots to park cars.  Guided by lasers, cameras, as well as markings on the ground, the robots will ferry cars - with a maximum weight of 2,600kg - from a drop-off point to the nearest available parking space.  Developed by engineering firm MHE-Demag, it is believed to be the first application of the technology in Singapore.  Unlike other mechanised parking systems the system does not require steel supporting structures or parking pallets, said MHE-Demag sales and markets regional director Klaus Schilling. Parking pallets are platforms on which cars are placed on before moving them.  ""No additional building provision is required for the system and it can be adapted into a conventional parking provision in any building development easily,"" he said.  The parking fee will be ""similar"" to other carparks, he added.  At CapitaGreen, across the road from Robinson Towers, it costs $3.10 per half hour to park between 7am and 6pm on weekdays.  Conventional mechanised parking systems - which use mechanical car lifters to carry a car to a storage space - can be found at several locations in Singapore, including three Housing Board car parks at Changi Village, Yishun and Bukit Panjang.  During peak periods, retrieving a car from these carparks can take about 10 to 15 minutes.  MHE-Demag's system offers ""relatively faster"" parking and retrieval times, said Mr Schilling, adding that the average time to retrieve a car - which is done using a mobile app - will be about two minutes.  The firm is also looking at introducing the technology at ""several other locations"", which it did not disclose. It has also started to introduce the technology in other countries in the region including Malaysia and Indonesia.  While the firm declined to say how much the system will cost, a similar system by Chinese firm Yee Fung Automation - introduced in Nanjing, China in December last year - is said to cost around $200,000.",2017-02-06,"Robinson Towers to feature robotic parking by 2018 ... firm MHE-Demag, it is believed to be the first application of the technology in Singapore.",Robinson Towers to feature robotic parking by 2018,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/robinson-towers-to-feature-robotic-parking-by-2018
43,"Nadine, a robot receptionist at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), is staring at the visitor in front of her. ""I remember you,"" she says. ""You were here last Saturday.""  The long-haired, uncannily human-looking robot pauses as her software runs through past interactions to figure out the most appropriate thing to say. Finally, she settles on: ""We talked about your job.""  At the National University of Singapore campus, a driverless cart attempts to navigate along a crowded walkway. When it senses a person in front of it, it stops; and as the crowd disperses, it inches forward, having learnt when to stop when an obstacle impedes its progress and when it is safe to move again.  These are two of the latest artificial intelligence (AI) projects that local researchers are working on as Singapore positions itself to grab a piece of the global market tipped to reach US$5.05 billion (S$6.8 billion) by 2020.  The revenue prediction by India- based research and consulting firm MarketsandMarkets was based on an expected rise in the adoption of AI in media and advertising, retail, finance and healthcare, growing from a market size of US$419.7 million in 2014.  The new wave of AI machines like Nadine has moved beyond traditional AI design, in which machines are given specific instructions to follow with no room for improvisation.  Rather, they tap into a subfield of AI, called machine learning, in which machines generate new outcomes for themselves after learning from previous outcomes.  ""Nadine could eventually act as a robotic caretaker for the sick or elderly,"" said NTU's Professor Nadia Thalmann, Nadine's creator.  Machine learning was thrust into the spotlight last month when a computer program, AlphaGo, beat one of the highest-ranking players in the world 4-1 in the ancient, complex board game of Go.  Such a feat was thought to be at least five years away, and would not have been possible without machine learning. It would have been impossible to code all the optimal moves into the software as the number of moves on the evolving board state can exceed the number of atoms in the universe.  However, AlphaGo's developer company, DeepMind, fed the software millions of Go games and had it play against itself, where it eventually learnt and developed a play style of its own. AlphaGo's success brought renewed interest in the capabilities of machine learning.  While both AI and machine learning are not new, they have become more accessible to software developers due to two recent factors: the rapid increase in computational power and the proliferation of big data.  ""These two advances in computing technology made it possible for computers to efficiently crunch large amounts of data to look for patterns, and to have a wide dataset to learn from,"" said Associate Professor Steven Hoi, an expert in machine learning from the Singapore Management University.  Consumers are seeing the applications of machine learning in the smart devices in their hands. Speech-recognition software like Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, for instance, make use of machine learning to comprehend a user's voice and the spoken instructions to the phone via a process called natural language processing.  Machine learning also underlies many of Google's services found in Android devices. Google Photos, for instance, uses machine learning to learn and tag objects in its gallery.  When a user searches for ""cats"", for example, the app is able to pick out photos with cats in them, having learnt how to identify such felines through millions of examples.  According to Professor Alfred Huan, executive director of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's (A*Star) Institute of High Performance Computing, current capabilities of AI have reached near human-level performance in areas such as machine vision and speech recognition.  But while machine learning has enabled AI to leap ever closer to the ambitious goal of simulating human consciousness, experts say there is still a long way to go before the days of robotic superiority.  ""As impressive as these feats have been, machines are still nowhere near the intelligence of even a two-year-old child,"" said Prof Huan. ""We are still far away from any truly intelligent machine capable of replacing humans.""  Machine learning is a subset of the field of computer science known as artificial intelligence (AI), which seeks to simulate the workings of a human brain.  Machine learning is a form of programming, where the software improves its response after learning from previous responses, rather than following only scripted responses.  Nascent forms of machine learning first emerged some 20 years ago. The most modern form is ""deep learning"", which tries to model the neural networks of the human brain by identifying millions of patterns in large datasets to predict the next outcome.  It plays an important role in big data analytics and is currently the rage in machine-learning research, given the accessibility of big data and computational power.  Professor Lee Wee Sun, vice-dean of undergraduate studies at the National University of Singapore's School of Computing, says ""true"" AI is still far off in the future because there are four requirements for software before it can be deemed ""intelligent"": learning, planning, reasoning and knowledge representation.  So, while machines may currently be able to crunch large amounts of data and make accurate decisions, such as when to buy and sell in the stock market based on statistical predictions, the human mind may never be replaced in areas like artistic creativity or coming up with novel solutions to open-ended problems.",2016-04-19,"Nadine, a robot receptionist at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), is staring at the visitor in front of her.

44,"Your future home might be planned using virtual reality, built with a 3D printer and inspected by a robot for quality.  What may sound like a sci-fi movie could become reality in a few decades as Singapore ramps up its construction productivity and employs more efficient building methods.  Construction site productivity has grown by an average rate of 1.3 per cent per year since 2009 but there is still room for improvement, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong yesterday at the launch of the Singapore Construction Productivity Week at the Singapore Expo.  As such, the Government is adopting a string of measures to raise productivity growth to the national target of 3 per cent per year.  This comes amid a need to overcome manpower constraints as Singapore continues to develop and take on more construction projects, such as the upcoming Jurong Lake District and waterfront city at Tanjong Pagar, Mr Wong said.  The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has come up with a new road map that will see the industry develop, adapt and adopt technologies in areas such as robotics, 3D printing and prefabrication in factories.  Such methods, some of which are already in practice here, are expected to speed up the building process, rely on fewer workers and boost construction quality.  About 400 industry players, public agencies, institutes of higher learning and research institutions were consulted for this road map.  ""BCA will now study how we can support these different research priorities and give them a greater push,"" said Mr Wong.  BCA chief executive John Keung said the first step is to look for funding for such technologies, which are typically more expensive. But he is not too worried about cost.  Said Dr Keung: ""Once the industry is familiar with (such technologies), there will be economies of scale... and the cost will come down.""  Some of these technologies were on show yesterday at the event's BuildTech Asia exhibition, organised by Sphere Exhibits and hosted by BCA.  Nanyang Technological University's Singapore Centre for 3D Printing, for instance, showcased a 3D printer that can produce concrete structures.  The Government will also look at stipulating productivity outcomes, such as manpower savings, for future Government Land Sales (GLS) sites, but without mandating any specific technology.  Currently, the use of specific technologies, such as prefabricated pre-finished volumetric construction, has been mandated for selected GLS sites.  But the new requirement will allow ""more innovation and scope"" for firms bidding for the sites to come up with their own productive methods, said Dr Keung.",2016-10-18,"Nanyang Technological University's Singapore Centre for 3D Printing, for instance, showcased a 3D printer that can produce concrete ...",Use robot to check buildings in quality test?,http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/use-robot-check-buildings-quality-test
45,"Staff at the Park Avenue Rochester Hotel were introduced to two new colleagues last month - both made of metal and plastic and named Techi.  The 1.38m-tall robots deliver trolleys of duvets, pillow cases and towels at the 311-room hotel in Buona Vista - the first here to turn to robotics to cope with the labour shortage.  They navigate around the hotel, ride lifts on their own and have sensors that enable them to avoid obstacles such as walls and people.  Each robot uses driverless technology and can be controlled via a tablet to deliver items like toilet paper or extra pillows to guests. They can also be pre-programmed to perform routine tasks such as the daily delivery of clean linen to different floors.  Besides alleviating the labour shortage, having the robots do most of the manual work means that housekeeping staff have more time and energy to do other tasks, such as interacting with guests and inspecting rooms to ensure they are clean and well stocked, said the hotel's general manager Ryan Sun.  The hotel has only 23 of the 29 room attendants it needs. With the two robot housekeepers - which together can perform the job of three full-time employees in a year - the shortage is reduced to three workers.  Out to deliver trolley of linen A robot housekeeper helps to deliver a trolley of linen from the third-floor housekeeping room right up to the 23rd floor of the hotel. Here's how it does it. 1 Techi is pre-programmed to perform the task. It moves off from its charging bay and picks up a trolley of linen. The location of the trolley, placed there by housekeeping staff, is marked out by a yellow box on the ground. 2 Carrying the trolley, Techi takes the lift to the respective floor. It ""communicates"" with the lift using Wi-Fi. Sensors help the robot avoid obstacles. 3 Upon reaching the floor, Techi deposits the trolley at a designated spot outside the lift. 4 Techi re-enters the lift and returns to the housekeeping area to collect the next trolley of linen, and the cycle is repeated.  For linen attendant Tok Geok Lan, 47, managing the inventory is now less strenuous. But she had to pick up a new skill - learning how to use the tablet to control the robots.  "" The first time I used the tablet, I was confused,"" said Madam Tok, who joined the hotel eight months ago. ""But I attended training for one week on how to use it and, now, I think it's quite cool.""  The job scope may have changed, but staff salaries remain the same.  The pair of robots were partially funded by the Singapore Tourism Board's (STB) Business Improvement Fund. It is believed they each cost around $100,000 and were developed by an American company.  Mr Sun believes the Techi robots have the potential to perform other tasks, like helping guests who use wheelchairs to get around, delivering luggage or doing night patrols.  In two weeks, guests may meet a third new member of the team: another Techi that can deliver room- service orders on its own. This robot, which has eyes, giving it a friendlier appearance, is supported by funding from Spring Singapore.  The hotel may be the first to use robots here, but the practice has taken off overseas. In south-west Japan, one hotel has been staffed almost entirely by robots since July last year. And at Yotel hotel in New York City, a floor-to-ceiling robot arm called Yobot picks up luggage and stores it in lockers for guests.  Park Avenue Rochester's use of Techi may be a game changer here.  Ms Ong Huey Hong, STB's director of hotels and sector manpower, said it is in talks with other hotels that are interested in robotic solutions.  At a tourism sector conference in April, Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) S. Iswaran highlighted the robotics project at Park Avenue Rochester, calling it ""an excellent example of STB partnering the industry to seek out innovative solutions and test-bed applications"".",2016-08-14,Each robot uses driverless technology and can be controlled via a tablet to ...

The world's present situation today involves the imbalance between the population and source of food. Basfreported how robots and high-tech solutions contribute in the fight against world hunger in several ways.    Like Us on Facebook  Recent researchers showed a projection that there will be two billion people who will need to be fed in the next 33 years. This incurs a huge problem and food crisis, the reason why scientists today studies, how to end hunger in the next couple of years though it hasn't been started yet.    According to Science Daily, three years ago, the National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded $20 million grant for the University of Missouri for a paid study on how corn still maintains root growth despite the drought conditions. To support the study, the university engineers developed a robot that changed the scientist's ways.    Since that time, the robot contributed and made a difference in the study of crops in times of drought. Another great contribution of robot and high-tech solutions is the creation of green walls in cities. Green walls aim the use of vertical spaces in actual farming such as the side of a building or apartments.    Founder and President of the Earth Policy Institute, Lester R. Brown, believes that ""Food is the new oil, a land is a new gold."" Because of this, planting was conceptualized to be on Sky Greens, a nine-meter-high planting shelves used for cabbage, spinach, and lettuce. This vertical farming method was proven effective in Singapore and Japan factories.    Additionally, with the aid of a tablet or smartphone, farming becomes modernized. The apps help in diagnosing crop diseases so that it can be further sustained. There will also be camera-assisted sprayers that save time and precisely targets the leaves of plants making it more efficient.    The contribution of robots and high-tech solutions in farming and agriculture is a great demand which international organizations should focus. This fight for hunger should be well organized and given attention for the benefits of humanities in the future.

49,"Were covering 3D printing education, business, international events and conferences, and a couple of Kickstarter campaigns in todays edition of 3D Printing News Briefs. Penn State is now offering masters degrees in 3D printing, while Structo has announced a distribution partnership with 4Qube Solutions. Weve got highlights from recent manufacturing technology industry event MTA 2017, the International Conference on Additive Manufacturing and 3D Printing announced anIndustrial Realities of Manufacturing Day for this summer, and Mimaki USA will preview its new UV-cure inkjet 3D printer prototype at ITA 2017. In addition, both GeckoTek and Makertech 3D are launching Kickstarter campaigns.  Pending its presentation to the Board of Trustees, Penn State will be offering residential and online masters degrees in additive manufacturing and design starting in fall 2017. The residential Master of Science in Additive Manufacturing (MSAMD) and the online Master of Engineering in Additive Manufacturing (MEngAMD) are both 30-credit degrees, and were developed in response to the increased industry demand for additive manufacturing experts. These advanced degrees will be offered to graduate students, in order to provide them both the practical and analytical skills necessary to digitally design, develop, analyze, numerically model, optimize, fabricate, and inspect new components and subassemblies using additive manufacturing technologies.  Coursework will be integrated across multiple departments and two colleges, and all students enrolled in either the online or residential program are required to spend time working on-site at the university, including in its additive manufacturing laboratory, CIMP-3D, and the Materials Characterization Laboratory(MCL) in the Millennium Sciences Complex. Students will work with both metallic and polymer additive manufacturing systems, and learn to grow as manufacturing leaders, while developing innovative solutions and maintaining high ethical standards.  In an effort to continue accelerating its global presence, and to match the high demand for its technology in the US, Singapore-based dental 3D printing solutions provider Structo announced that CAD/CAM solution distributor 4Qube Solutionswill be an authorized US distributor of its MSLA-equipped OrthoForm 3D printer.  4Qube Solutions will expand the reach of Structos MSLA-equipped OrthoForm 3D printer in the US, and provide fast response times to technical queries, quality customer service, and after-sales support to regional customers. 4Qube Solutions will be exhibiting at the upcoming American Association of Orthodontists (AAO) Annual Session in San Diego next week, and will be offering visitors a hands-on experience with the OrthoForm.  Over 10,000 people, from 43 countries and regions, attended MTA 2017(Manufacturing Technology Asia), Asias premier manufacturing technology industry event, which ended last Friday in Singapore. There were 300 exhibits, and the conference got together over 30 industry experts and leaders who shared their thoughts on a variety of topics, from augmented reality and robotics to the IIoT and Industry 4.0.  A big draw at the event was robotics: Epson launched its new N2 robots, featured the worlds first patented compact folding arm technology, while Nachi exhibited its best-selling table top robot, along with its range of robotic arms. Another area of focus at MTA 2017 was 3D printing, and people who visited the show floor exhibits, attended interactive seminars, and went on technology tours were able to see the many different concepts and industrial applications for the technology, across multiple industries. Exhibitors included SLM Solutions, Renishaw, EOS, Siemens, and BeAM, among several others.  Industrial Realities of Manufacturing Day Held Before International Conference on Additive Manufacturing and 3D Printing  From July 12 to 13, the 12th annual International Conference on Additive Manufacturing and 3D Printing will be held in the UK. Over 250 additive manufacturing and 3D printing academics and industry professionals will gather for two days in Nottingham, to share knowledge, ideas, and the latest technology developments. Event registration is currentlyopen, and you can also register for a special conference kick-off event called Industrial Realities of Manufacturing Day. Innovate UKs Knowledge Transfer Network, together with its Special Interest Group in Additive Manufacturing, is putting on the event, designed to helpbusinesses cut through the hype and grasp the opportunities Additive Manufacturing can offer.  Several AM experts and practitioners will be speaking at the pre-conference session, including Phil Reeves of Stratasys Expert Services and Sophie Jones from Added Scientific. The speakers will talk about lessons learned and the challenges theyve faced while using AM technologies. An afternoon session will offer insights and information on the UKs National Strategy for Additive Manufacturing.  Wide-format inkjet printer and cutter manufacturer Mimaki USA, an operating entity of Japan-based Mimaki Engineering, will be showcasing its new 3D UV-cure inkjet printer prototype at the International Sign Expo 2017in Las Vegas later this week. Back in 2015, Mimaki Engineering announced its venture into the world of 3D printers and began development on its own full-color machine. The company has now entered the commercialization phase for its provisionally named 3DUJ-P 3D printer, after the machines recent worldwide introduction at JapanShop last month.  Mimakis 3D printer has over 10 million possible color combinations, thanks to its full-color UV-cure method, and offers unique, water-soluble support material that saves time on finishing a product, and allows for fine detail. It offers high quality, precise 3D printing, and the printer also utilizes clear inks, which can be jetted independently or combined with colored ink to make translucent objects.  University of Bristol Student Launching Kickstarter Campaign for Proforge 3D Printer  Adeel Ali, a mechanical engineering student at the University of Bristol, recently launched a Kickstarter campaign for his open source Proforge 3D printer. Ali says the 3D printer, which is intended for the average maker or hobbyist and encased in an aluminum and HDPE frame, features off-the-shelf parts, a 200 x 200 mm heated print bed, auto-leveling, a dedicated power supply, and LCD screen/SD card reader.  The Proforge can also be upgraded to have a full enclosure, and its expandable features include a plotter, a laser engraver, and a light CNC mill. It offers a resolution of up to 50 micron layers, and is compatible with multiple materials, including PETG, ABS, and exotics. Ali is making a maximum of 150 Proforge 3D printers for the campaign, to cut back on over subscription clogging, and to ensure that the people who pledged can receive their 3D printers on time. The early birdprice is just279, and the campaign is already approaching its funding goal with 26 days left.  GeckoTek Funding New Product Launch Through Second Kickstarter Campaign  Ohio startup GeckoTek 3D Printer Build Plates, based out of Cincinnatis HCDC business incubator, is launching a second Kickstarter campaign. The company received $60,000 to set up operations and produce its GeckoTek 3D Printer Build Plate during its 2014 Kickstarter campaign, but thanks to increased product sales (the company has shipped over 5,000 build plates), and end-user suggestions and requests, the startup has developed a new, lower-cost build surface. Youll want to order the EZ Stick Build Surface fast, as the $15 early bird pre-orderreward is already gone.  The EZ Stick Build Surface can be cut with scissors to fit on any 3D printer currently on the market, and its durable coating allows for up to 200 uses before needing a replacement. Its high-temperature, pressure-sensitive adhesive backing allows it to peel and stickto the 3D printer easily, without using any binder clips, and it offers a bubble-free application, thanks to its thick polymer film. The Hot version is for 3D printers with heated beds, which is an ideal choice for engineers and designers, and the Cold version is perfect for educators who prefer a non-heated 3D printer for safety purposes.

52,"Every six months, the pieces of silicon glue used on a fan cover of an aircraft engine need to be replaced.  A worker takes eight to 12 hours to complete the tedious task. But a robot does it in four hours.  Such industrial robots are increasingly being used on the factory floor, prompting the introduction of a new training programme.  Announced yesterday, its aim is to train more than 2,000 professionals, managers, executives and technicians in the next two years to operate and implement automated production systems.  The training will be done by the Robotics Application Centre of Excellence (Race), a collaboration between professors from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and local precision engineering company PBA Group.  Said Race chief executive Derrick Yap: ""South-east Asia has been earmarked to be the factory of the world and Singapore, being at the epicentre of the region, is very well-positioned (to take advantage of this).""  The series of courses under the new Robotics Applications Training and Education Programme starts on Jan 11, with a one-day ""novice"" level session for people without any technical background in robotics and automation. They will learn about technology trends and how to analyse the cost-effectiveness of adopting robotics and automation. The session costs $50 for Singaporeans, after subsidies.  The next two higher-level courses, each to run for five days, will be launched in March, with another two to follow later.  Mr Gilbert Tan, chief executive of the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), urged firms and industries to prepare for the future and adopt more advanced technology in manufacturing. His institute has signed an agreement with Race and Workforce Singapore to develop skills training and support employers in staff development.  Race will also team up with the Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association and e2i, to help its members learn about technology and buy more of it.  Yesterday, Race held a session on it for about 40 company officials.

53,"With Singapore's rapidly-ageing population, there will be more seniors needing care in future, but not enough carers to do the job.  This is why hospitals are turning to robots and other assistive technology to ease the burden on the manpower-strapped sector.  Instead of a nurse checking every 15 minutes for six hours, to see if a patient who has had a cathether inserted is bleeding, a special blood-sensitive ""bandage"" can do the job, freeing the nurse for six hours of more fulfilling work.  A robot, not a therapist, can help recovering stroke patients exercise; another can keep early stage dementia patients occupied and alert them to take their medicine, or to call for a helper when it senses that they are struggling to get up.  Call it Changi General Hospital's answer to the labour crunch. This technology can become mainstream within the next few years.

If it works as well as expected, it can be used not only for dialysis patients, but also heart patients who have had a stent put in, or had to do an angiogram to check the heart.  Bleeding from the puncture hole is rare, said Dr Chionh, but should it happen, a patient can bleed to death if not treated imediately. The SUTD device can tell blood from other fluids, and will set off an alarm if it senses one millilitre of blood.     Health Minister Gan Kim Yong looks at a HOSPI Autonomous Delivery Robot during the opening of the new Integrated Building at Changi General Hospital on 23 July, 2015.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG     The idea for the Centre for Healthcare Assitive and Robotics Technology (Chart), started early last year and launched by President Tony Tan on Thursday (July 23), was triggered by the visit of a team from Japan in 2012 wanting to know if there was a market for such products.  Dr Lee Chien Earn, CGH's Chief Executive Officer, said some technology might be great, but not what patients or hospitals want. So CGH decided to work with industry on what it needs instead.  ""It's better to create solutions to meet needs,"" he said. ""The user must be involved from the start.""  The technology does not have to be new, he said. It can be something used in other industries that can be adapted to healthcare needs.  Examples that are now being tweaked to fit healthcare settings include automated guided vehicles (AGV) used in warehouses. The unit can carry shelves holding food, linen or files, or move heavy items like beds. All it needs is a map of the hospital to find its way around.  The idea is to ""take the manual out of healthcare"", said Chart's director Ms Selina Seah, adding that it is increasingly hard to find people to fill jobs like porters.  A team from the Nanyang Technological University took six months to convert an industrial robotic arm to pick and pack a range of objects, including fragile items.  Ms Seah said the robot arm can work non-stop and do the job without mistakes, unlike people who get tired and could become careless.  Dr Tan said Chart provides a platform for research institutes, companies and healthcare practitioners to collaborate in the development of new, impactful healthcare delivery solutions.  He revealed that Chart will be part of the National Robotics Programme. The Government will release details later this year of this multi-agency initiative to test-bed robotic technologies across various sectors, he said.

54,"When she got married 10 years ago, Ms Pranoti Nagarkar Israni, co-founder of automatic roti- maker Rotimatic, would painstakingly make chapati, an Indian flat bread, for her husband.  The time-consuming and tedious task of kneading the dough and slaving behind the stove every day got her thinking of developing an automatic roti-maker.  As it turned out, she and her husband Rishi Israni, both 34 and graduates from the National University of Singapore, were perfectly suited to the task.  Ms Nagarkar is a mechanical engineer, while Mr Rishi is a computer science graduate who ran his own mobile security company. So, she took charge of figuring out the mechanics of the roti-maker, while he figured out the software technology.  The India-born Singapore citizens, who have a three-year-old son, started Zimplistic in 2008. Eight years later, the company's first and only product, the Rotimatic, has finally been shipped to its first batch of customers. They had placed orders in 2014.  The robotic roti-maker received special mention in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech last Sunday.  1. Plug in the Rotimatic and switch it on. It takes three to four minutes to heat up. Meanwhile, fill the compartments with flour, oil and water. 2. On the touchscreen, select the number of roti required, the thickness, roast level and amount of oil (one or two drops for each roti). Press the start button. 3. The machine will start to churn out a ball of dough from the flour, oil and water. If the dough is not formed properly, an error message will appear and the dough can be removed by opening the side door to the machine. The dough-making will then resume. 4. Once the dough is formed, a lever pushes it onto a hot pan to cook. The dough is flattened into a disc and it puffs up while cooking . When the first roti is being cooked, the machine will start kneading the dough for the next one. 5. Once cooked, the roti is pushed out onto the attached (removable) tray. It is best eaten hot with curry, as a wrap with filling or as a dessert crepe. 6. The machine can make up to 20 roti in less than 30 minutes. If there is not enough flour, water or oil in the containers, the machine will prompt the user to add more ingredients. 7. To clean the Rotimatic, the ingredient containers and parts used for the kneading of the dough can be removed for washing. When cool, the hot pan (not removable) can be wiped clean.  Watch how the Rotimatic works at str.sg/4cGh  When speaking on promoting entrepreneurship, he cited it as one of the success stories from start-up hot spot Block 71 in Ayer Rajah Crescent. It is run by the JTC Corporation and is part of the JTC LaunchPad programme, which provides a nurturing environment for start-ups.  Zimplistic's office is now located in Commonwealth Lane.  The machine can make up to 20 cooked roti in under 30 minutes, using only whole wheat flour, oil and water.  Users select the thickness of the roti, roast level, amount of oil and number of roti required, and press a button to start the process.  Each Rotimatic is priced at US$999 (S$1,351). It is made in Malaysia, weighs 18kg and is about the size of a microwave oven.  Pre-orders for the next batch of machines are likely to open next month, says Ms Nagarkar, but deliveries may be made only in the first quarter of next year, as the company is now shipping machines to customers in the United States who pre-ordered them.  Shipment has been completed for the ""few hundred"" Singapore orders.  Within five days of launching pre-orders in the US and Singapore in June 2014, the company received more than 8,000 orders.  Ms Nagarkar says customers were updated via e-mail about the progress and were allowed to request refunds at any time. Seven per cent of customers who preordered asked for refunds, she adds.  On the challenges faced at the beginning, she says: ""Many people thought the Rotimatic was a crazy idea. Building a team and getting investors were tough. We needed to raise money and credibility.""  To build buzz, she took part in the Start-Up @Singapore Business Plan Competition in 2009 and won the top prize of $40,000 for the Rotimatic.  The following year, the company got its first seed funding of US$400,000 from angel investors. In 2012, Zimplistic received US$3 million from private investors and, in July last year, another US$11.5 million of funding was received from venture capital firm NSI Ventures and global engineering giant Robert Bosch GMbH.  Calling the eight years it took to perfect the Rotimatic a ""humbling experience"", she says: ""We took time to stabilise the system, to make sure every roti is consistent. For the past two years, we would make 2,000 roti daily in the office, to test the reliability of the machine.""  Of course, the Rotimatic is not perfect. Currently, it can work with only one brand of flour - Aashirvaad whole wheat flour - which can be bought online at www.myonlinegroceries.com. It costs $2 for a 1kg bag.  If the ball of dough rolled out is not ""perfect"", the machine will alert users to discard the dough before churning out another batch.  Ms Nagarkar says: ""For the first batch of machines that we have sent out, perhaps the first five roti may not be great. It is also a learning path for the machine.""  There are plans to upgrade the software so users can make other types of flat breads and add ingredients such as herbs and spices to the dough.  The smart flat bread-maker is programmed to enable software upgrades over the cloud and remote troubleshooting via an app.  This will also allow users to get recipes from Zimplistic's in-house chef, who was initially hired to provide meals for the 85 office staff. The chef now helps in product development.  Ms Nagarkar hopes to sell the Rotimatic to other countries such as India, as well as in the Middle East and Britain.  The product will be sold exclusively online - she has no plans to sell it in supermarkets or department stores. However, she does not rule out doing product demonstrations for consumers to understand how the machine works.  On the hefty price tag, she says the Rotimatic - with its smart functions and cooking abilities - is unlike other kitchen appliances.  She says: ""The making of roti - it's the same amount of hassle and pain required when washing clothes with your hands. When you have a washing machine, you realise how much time it saves you.  ""Rotimatic is similar, in terms of saving you time and tedious labour. And you get a cooked product at the end of it.""

58,"SINGAPORE - The National Robotics Programme, which was announced last year (2015), will be scaled up this year with the announcement of more than $450 million to support it over the next three years.  Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat made the announcement in his Budget speech on Wednesday (March 24) as he spoke about industry-level transformation.  Developing and deploying new technologies to solve problems that are relevant for the entire industry can drive industry-level transformation, he said.  Robotics technology can enable us to work more effectively in a tight labour market, and can also create more high value-added jobs, he added.  Keeping that in view, the ministry will work with solution providers to offer packaged solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at a reasonable cost.  Robotics and automation technology can be applied widely to transform sectors such as healthcare, construction, manufacturing and logistics.  Using the example of robotics in the healthcare industry, Mr Heng said the technology is being used in pharmacies in hospitals to pick medication accurately and quickly, which frees up time for staff to give advice on the medication.  Autonomous transporters are also being used to move supplies efficiently in hospitals.  Power-assisted bed transport technologies to reduce the manual effort in moving patients are also being tried out, he said.",2016-03-24,"SINGAPORE - The National Robotics Programme, which was ...

59,"The robot, PictoBot, can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.  SINGAPORE: A spray-painting robot could halve the number of workers needed to paint walls at industrial developments, do the job 25 per cent faster and improve safety, announced Nanyang Technological University (NTU), JTC and the National Research Foundation (NRF) on Wednesday (Oct 26).  Industrial buildings come with high ceilings to accommodate bulky equipment and materials. Currently, the conventional method for spray painting requires a team of two painters using a scissor lift to reach the high ceilings.  ""Working at such heights exposes painters to various safety risks,"" they said.  In comparison, the 1.5-tonne PictoBot needs only one human supervisor on ground level. Using its optical camera and laser scanner, the robot can navigate and paint walls up to 10 metres high with its robotic arm.  PictoBot can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.     It can also work four hours on one battery charge, giving walls an even coat of paint that matches industry standards. It can even operate in the dark, the organisations added.  These features allow the robot to paint continuously day or night, improving efficiency and freeing up manpower.  Developed in a year at NTU's Robotic Research Centre, the project is supported under NRF's Test-Bedding and Demonstration of Innovative Research funding initiative which aims to use Government-led demand efforts to demonstrate feasibility of innovative technologies and catalyse adoption by private sectors.  To ensure that PictoBot meets industry standards, its developers said it will be tested at industrial developments such as JTC Space @ Gul.  JTC Director of Innovation Programme Office and Corporate Planning Anil Das said that such robotic solutions help improve the productivity of the construction industry.  ""Developers can go to market a lot faster and industry players can continue with us to develop even more innovative solutions to alleviate some of the construction productivity challenges that we face today,"" he said.  As for how jobs in the future will be affected by autonomous robots, NTU Robotic Research Centre Director Professor Chen I-Ming said workers will be able to upgrade their skills and will be trained to operate the machines.

60,"From waiting tables to picking out medicine, robots are transforming the way people work. NTU researchers are even perfecting a robot that tutors primary school children.  SINGAPORE: More companies are looking to using robots to take over tasks traditionally performed by workers. This can help improve productivity and address the issue of manpower shortage.  Researchers from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have envisioned that in schools of the future, robots will be able to guide children in their lessons, so that teachers will have more time to observe students behaviour and identify their needs.  ""Imagine we are putting a more structured curriculum into the robot to help tutor the lower primary school kids, like those in P1, P2 - a companion robot to help them go through their curriculum, explained Dr Chen I-Ming, director of NTUs Robotics Research Centre.  The researchers have come up with a prototype that it has tested in some kindergartens. The project is funded by the Singapore Millennium Fund, a foundation supported by Temasek Trust.  Children would be able to control the movements of the robots using sensors. Teachers can also benefit, by doing voice recordings of stories using the robots and playing them back to the students.    For teachers, it also means picking up a new skill. ""I have some problems because I'm not very familiar (with it), said Ms Leela Chua, a teacher with Youth Progress Singapore. Teachers should be open. It's lifelong learning - we should always look forward to something new, something up to date.""  Dr Chen said that since 2013, more companies have shown an interest in robotics, and have approached the university to enquire about collaborations.    ""It's actually different from sector to sector. If you are in manufacturing sectors, their main goal is to improve productivity. If it's anything that really improves productivity, they will take it up immediately, said Dr Chen. But for other social or educational types of robots, they need to go through a lengthy case study, or test-bedding and also prove the results. That will probably take a bit much longer. You still need probably two to three years at least.    Robot waiter Techi can work long hours, deliver food and drinks to customers and even take the lift to hand over toiletries to hotel guests. The company behind the robot said more than 10 firms will be using it from March.    ""Our aim is to replace the repeated, tiring jobs for human beings, so that they can concentrate more on the productive work, said Techmetics chairman and technical director Mathan Muthupillai. If you talk about the F&B side, waiters are spending more time on actually taking the items and delivering them to the table - that work can be actually taken care of by the robot.    Mr Neelendra Jain, founder and CEO of food and beverage solutions provider The Happy Roots, said with non-skilled tasks being diverted to robots, staff will be able to focus on work which would require their skills.    At KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, a robotic bottle-dispensing system was rolled out in 2015. It can load, pick, assemble and label medicine bottles. Before the medicine is dispensed to patients, pharmacy staff will perform an additional round of checks.  This replaces many of the manual tasks involved, saving around 8,760 man-hours a year. Previously, staff had to manually pick, pack, assemble, barcode, and track expiry dates and batch numbers, across various types of bottled medication.    At first, me and my colleagues were a bit apprehensive about operating the machines as we didn't know what to expect, whether the machines will be beneficial for us, said Ms Hamidah Rahmat, a senior pharmacy technician at KKH. But after a while, the vendors, the engineers taught us how to operate the machines. They taught us how to troubleshoot. After practice, after getting used to it, now we are more confident.""

61,"EXCLUSIVE: Singapore researchers are testing robotic swans that could provide essential, highly advanced water testing in reservoirs around the country and the world.  SINGAPORE: Floating on the surface of Pandan Reservoir in Singapores south west are what researchers hope will be the future of cheap, real-time water quality testing.  Developed by a team at the National University of Singapore (NUS), in conjunction with the national water agency PUB, the NUSwan utilises advanced water monitoring technology, fitted into the shell that closely resembles a living, breathing bird.  We started with a number of smaller bird models, before we decided on the swan. Its just the right size, said Assistant Professor Mandar Chitre, one of the projects lead researchers. If you look at it in the environment, it just looks like a swan swimming around.  A small team at the NUS Environmental Research Institute, working with the Tropical Marine Science Institute, initially conceptualised the robot back in 2010 but only began their first series of test bedding last year.  The aim is to mobilise the robotic swans to monitor different physical and biological compounds in fresh water, including pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and chlorophyll, which are common indicators used to determine if there are problems in a water source.  At present, water authorities face the logistical challenge of physically having to collect samples from large bodies of water, normally using a boat. It is an approach that requires time and manpower and restricts the speed at which officials can act in the case of an outbreak or a contamination.  It would be expensive to do similar monitoring manually or using AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), said Asst Prof Chitre. Hence to reduce reliance on manpower and increase efficiency in water quality monitoring, we are constantly looking into developing new technology with improved capabilities.  Scientifically, the NUSwan test drives a new paradigm of freshwater monitoring, one that is persistent and interactive, and is potentially able to sample the dynamics of water quality over space and time at improved resolution at an affordable cost, he added.  The swans work by trawling particular areas of interest in a water body and wirelessly sending back data through cloud computing. Programmers will be able to remotely control the robots, but the aim is to ensure they are as autonomous as possible, requiring just basic monitoring and operation, which can happen from anywhere with an internet connection.  The researchers said the swans navigation is more advanced than an automatic vacuum cleaner for instance, which can avoid obstacles but cannot tell where it has already travelled. The SWAN uses GPS to ensure it does not duplicate its monitoring efforts, unless programmed to.  They are durable enough such that even if a recreational water user such as a kayaker, or even a small boat, hits the swan, it will not be damaged, according to the teams behind the technology.  They believe they are at just the tip of realising the potential of this system and have designed the NUSwan to be adaptable to various environmental challenges that may arise.  The NUSwan platform is designed to be extendable  new sensors and actuators can be added on demand to increase its sensing capability, said Mr Koay Teong Beng, one of the other leading researchers on the project.  Already the team is collaborating with other university researchers to combine technologies and stretch the swans to their technological limits.  This includes a highly sensitive freshwater phosphate sensor, which is being developed independently by a separate NUS team. Phosphates are key nutrients in the development of blue-green algal blooms, which can be devastating for water sources.  There is a hope that technology such as the phosphate sensor could be mobilised by the NUSwan, and provide a real-world alarm system to the threat of algal blooms, a common problem encountered in more polluted waterways as a result of fertilisers, sewerage and domestic waste.  Earlier this year, a proliferation of algal blooms in oxygen-depleted, bacteria-rich waters caused thousands of fish to die. While the phosphate sensor has only been tested in fresh water, it is this kind of scenario that it is designed to help prevent.  Phosphate detection was lacking; phosphate sensors are not available in the market, said Lanry Yung, Associate Professor of Chemical and Bio-molecule Engineering . The prototype is finished. Now we are trying to do automation and collaboration with the NUSwan team to work on hardware.  Salt complicates the process, but nonetheless its something to look into at the next stage, he said.  The NUSwan has received interest from water authorities across the region, particularly in China where water pollution is a pressing issue and where the system will be tested on several rivers in the south of the country. That could potentially see the robotic swans floating on some of the worlds largest water reservoirs in the near future.  We see the potential of having NUSwans deployed in urban freshwater bodies and coastal water beyond Singapore. With the data stored in the cloud, collaborators may share and aggregate data and understand global phenomena, Asst Prof Chitre said.",2015-07-03,"EXCLUSIVE: Singapore researchers are testing robotic swans that could provide essential, highly advanced water testing in reservoirs around ...",Robot swans bring new advanced technology to water testing,http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/robot-swans-bring-new/1958380.html
62,"Every six months, the pieces of silicon glue used on a fan cover of an aircraft engine need to be replaced.  A worker takes eight to 12 hours to complete the tedious task. But a robot does it in four hours.  Such industrial robots are increasingly being used on the factory floor, prompting the introduction of a new training programme.  Announced yesterday, its aim is to train more than 2,000 professionals, managers, executives and technicians in the next two years to operate and implement automated production systems.  The training will be done by the Robotics Application Centre of Excellence (Race), a collaboration between professors from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and local precision engineering company PBA Group.  Said Race chief executive Derrick Yap: ""South-east Asia has been earmarked to be the factory of the world and Singapore, being at the epicentre of the region, is very well-positioned (to take advantage of this).""  The series of courses under the new Robotics Applications Training and Education Programme starts on Jan 11, with a one-day ""novice"" level session for people without any technical background in robotics and automation. They will learn about technology trends and how to analyse the cost-effectiveness of adopting robotics and automation. The session costs $50 for Singaporeans, after subsidies.  The next two higher-level courses, each to run for five days, will be launched in March, with another two to follow later.  Mr Gilbert Tan, chief executive of the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), urged firms and industries to prepare for the future and adopt more advanced technology in manufacturing. His institute has signed an agreement with Race and Workforce Singapore to develop skills training and support employers in staff development.  Race will also team up with the Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association and e2i, to help its members learn about technology and buy more of it.  Yesterday, Race held a session on it for about 40 company officials.

63,"With Singapore's rapidly-ageing population, there will be more seniors needing care in future, but not enough carers to do the job.  This is why hospitals are turning to robots and other assistive technology to ease the burden on the manpower-strapped sector.  Instead of a nurse checking every 15 minutes for six hours, to see if a patient who has had a cathether inserted is bleeding, a special blood-sensitive ""bandage"" can do the job, freeing the nurse for six hours of more fulfilling work.  A robot, not a therapist, can help recovering stroke patients exercise; another can keep early stage dementia patients occupied and alert them to take their medicine, or to call for a helper when it senses that they are struggling to get up.  Call it Changi General Hospital's answer to the labour crunch. This technology can become mainstream within the next few years.

If it works as well as expected, it can be used not only for dialysis patients, but also heart patients who have had a stent put in, or had to do an angiogram to check the heart.  Bleeding from the puncture hole is rare, said Dr Chionh, but should it happen, a patient can bleed to death if not treated imediately. The SUTD device can tell blood from other fluids, and will set off an alarm if it senses one millilitre of blood.     Health Minister Gan Kim Yong looks at a HOSPI Autonomous Delivery Robot during the opening of the new Integrated Building at Changi General Hospital on 23 July, 2015.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG     The idea for the Centre for Healthcare Assitive and Robotics Technology (Chart), started early last year and launched by President Tony Tan on Thursday (July 23), was triggered by the visit of a team from Japan in 2012 wanting to know if there was a market for such products.  Dr Lee Chien Earn, CGH's Chief Executive Officer, said some technology might be great, but not what patients or hospitals want. So CGH decided to work with industry on what it needs instead.  ""It's better to create solutions to meet needs,"" he said. ""The user must be involved from the start.""  The technology does not have to be new, he said. It can be something used in other industries that can be adapted to healthcare needs.  Examples that are now being tweaked to fit healthcare settings include automated guided vehicles (AGV) used in warehouses. The unit can carry shelves holding food, linen or files, or move heavy items like beds. All it needs is a map of the hospital to find its way around.  The idea is to ""take the manual out of healthcare"", said Chart's director Ms Selina Seah, adding that it is increasingly hard to find people to fill jobs like porters.  A team from the Nanyang Technological University took six months to convert an industrial robotic arm to pick and pack a range of objects, including fragile items.  Ms Seah said the robot arm can work non-stop and do the job without mistakes, unlike people who get tired and could become careless.  Dr Tan said Chart provides a platform for research institutes, companies and healthcare practitioners to collaborate in the development of new, impactful healthcare delivery solutions.  He revealed that Chart will be part of the National Robotics Programme. The Government will release details later this year of this multi-agency initiative to test-bed robotic technologies across various sectors, he said.

64,"When she got married 10 years ago, Ms Pranoti Nagarkar Israni, co-founder of automatic roti- maker Rotimatic, would painstakingly make chapati, an Indian flat bread, for her husband.  The time-consuming and tedious task of kneading the dough and slaving behind the stove every day got her thinking of developing an automatic roti-maker.  As it turned out, she and her husband Rishi Israni, both 34 and graduates from the National University of Singapore, were perfectly suited to the task.  Ms Nagarkar is a mechanical engineer, while Mr Rishi is a computer science graduate who ran his own mobile security company. So, she took charge of figuring out the mechanics of the roti-maker, while he figured out the software technology.  The India-born Singapore citizens, who have a three-year-old son, started Zimplistic in 2008. Eight years later, the company's first and only product, the Rotimatic, has finally been shipped to its first batch of customers. They had placed orders in 2014.  The robotic roti-maker received special mention in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech last Sunday.  1. Plug in the Rotimatic and switch it on. It takes three to four minutes to heat up. Meanwhile, fill the compartments with flour, oil and water. 2. On the touchscreen, select the number of roti required, the thickness, roast level and amount of oil (one or two drops for each roti). Press the start button. 3. The machine will start to churn out a ball of dough from the flour, oil and water. If the dough is not formed properly, an error message will appear and the dough can be removed by opening the side door to the machine. The dough-making will then resume. 4. Once the dough is formed, a lever pushes it onto a hot pan to cook. The dough is flattened into a disc and it puffs up while cooking . When the first roti is being cooked, the machine will start kneading the dough for the next one. 5. Once cooked, the roti is pushed out onto the attached (removable) tray. It is best eaten hot with curry, as a wrap with filling or as a dessert crepe. 6. The machine can make up to 20 roti in less than 30 minutes. If there is not enough flour, water or oil in the containers, the machine will prompt the user to add more ingredients. 7. To clean the Rotimatic, the ingredient containers and parts used for the kneading of the dough can be removed for washing. When cool, the hot pan (not removable) can be wiped clean.  Watch how the Rotimatic works at str.sg/4cGh  When speaking on promoting entrepreneurship, he cited it as one of the success stories from start-up hot spot Block 71 in Ayer Rajah Crescent. It is run by the JTC Corporation and is part of the JTC LaunchPad programme, which provides a nurturing environment for start-ups.  Zimplistic's office is now located in Commonwealth Lane.  The machine can make up to 20 cooked roti in under 30 minutes, using only whole wheat flour, oil and water.  Users select the thickness of the roti, roast level, amount of oil and number of roti required, and press a button to start the process.  Each Rotimatic is priced at US$999 (S$1,351). It is made in Malaysia, weighs 18kg and is about the size of a microwave oven.  Pre-orders for the next batch of machines are likely to open next month, says Ms Nagarkar, but deliveries may be made only in the first quarter of next year, as the company is now shipping machines to customers in the United States who pre-ordered them.  Shipment has been completed for the ""few hundred"" Singapore orders.  Within five days of launching pre-orders in the US and Singapore in June 2014, the company received more than 8,000 orders.  Ms Nagarkar says customers were updated via e-mail about the progress and were allowed to request refunds at any time. Seven per cent of customers who preordered asked for refunds, she adds.  On the challenges faced at the beginning, she says: ""Many people thought the Rotimatic was a crazy idea. Building a team and getting investors were tough. We needed to raise money and credibility.""  To build buzz, she took part in the Start-Up @Singapore Business Plan Competition in 2009 and won the top prize of $40,000 for the Rotimatic.  The following year, the company got its first seed funding of US$400,000 from angel investors. In 2012, Zimplistic received US$3 million from private investors and, in July last year, another US$11.5 million of funding was received from venture capital firm NSI Ventures and global engineering giant Robert Bosch GMbH.  Calling the eight years it took to perfect the Rotimatic a ""humbling experience"", she says: ""We took time to stabilise the system, to make sure every roti is consistent. For the past two years, we would make 2,000 roti daily in the office, to test the reliability of the machine.""  Of course, the Rotimatic is not perfect. Currently, it can work with only one brand of flour - Aashirvaad whole wheat flour - which can be bought online at www.myonlinegroceries.com. It costs $2 for a 1kg bag.  If the ball of dough rolled out is not ""perfect"", the machine will alert users to discard the dough before churning out another batch.  Ms Nagarkar says: ""For the first batch of machines that we have sent out, perhaps the first five roti may not be great. It is also a learning path for the machine.""  There are plans to upgrade the software so users can make other types of flat breads and add ingredients such as herbs and spices to the dough.  The smart flat bread-maker is programmed to enable software upgrades over the cloud and remote troubleshooting via an app.  This will also allow users to get recipes from Zimplistic's in-house chef, who was initially hired to provide meals for the 85 office staff. The chef now helps in product development.  Ms Nagarkar hopes to sell the Rotimatic to other countries such as India, as well as in the Middle East and Britain.  The product will be sold exclusively online - she has no plans to sell it in supermarkets or department stores. However, she does not rule out doing product demonstrations for consumers to understand how the machine works.  On the hefty price tag, she says the Rotimatic - with its smart functions and cooking abilities - is unlike other kitchen appliances.  She says: ""The making of roti - it's the same amount of hassle and pain required when washing clothes with your hands. When you have a washing machine, you realise how much time it saves you.  ""Rotimatic is similar, in terms of saving you time and tedious labour. And you get a cooked product at the end of it.""

68,"SINGAPORE - The National Robotics Programme, which was announced last year (2015), will be scaled up this year with the announcement of more than $450 million to support it over the next three years.  Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat made the announcement in his Budget speech on Wednesday (March 24) as he spoke about industry-level transformation.  Developing and deploying new technologies to solve problems that are relevant for the entire industry can drive industry-level transformation, he said.  Robotics technology can enable us to work more effectively in a tight labour market, and can also create more high value-added jobs, he added.  Keeping that in view, the ministry will work with solution providers to offer packaged solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at a reasonable cost.  Robotics and automation technology can be applied widely to transform sectors such as healthcare, construction, manufacturing and logistics.  Using the example of robotics in the healthcare industry, Mr Heng said the technology is being used in pharmacies in hospitals to pick medication accurately and quickly, which frees up time for staff to give advice on the medication.  Autonomous transporters are also being used to move supplies efficiently in hospitals.

69,"The robot, PictoBot, can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.  SINGAPORE: A spray-painting robot could halve the number of workers needed to paint walls at industrial developments, do the job 25 per cent faster and improve safety, announced Nanyang Technological University (NTU), JTC and the National Research Foundation (NRF) on Wednesday (Oct 26).  Industrial buildings come with high ceilings to accommodate bulky equipment and materials. Currently, the conventional method for spray painting requires a team of two painters using a scissor lift to reach the high ceilings.  ""Working at such heights exposes painters to various safety risks,"" they said.  In comparison, the 1.5-tonne PictoBot needs only one human supervisor on ground level. Using its optical camera and laser scanner, the robot can navigate and paint walls up to 10 metres high with its robotic arm.  PictoBot can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.     It can also work four hours on one battery charge, giving walls an even coat of paint that matches industry standards. It can even operate in the dark, the organisations added.  These features allow the robot to paint continuously day or night, improving efficiency and freeing up manpower.  Developed in a year at NTU's Robotic Research Centre, the project is supported under NRF's Test-Bedding and Demonstration of Innovative Research funding initiative which aims to use Government-led demand efforts to demonstrate feasibility of innovative technologies and catalyse adoption by private sectors.  To ensure that PictoBot meets industry standards, its developers said it will be tested at industrial developments such as JTC Space @ Gul.  JTC Director of Innovation Programme Office and Corporate Planning Anil Das said that such robotic solutions help improve the productivity of the construction industry.  ""Developers can go to market a lot faster and industry players can continue with us to develop even more innovative solutions to alleviate some of the construction productivity challenges that we face today,"" he said.  As for how jobs in the future will be affected by autonomous robots, NTU Robotic Research Centre Director Professor Chen I-Ming said workers will be able to upgrade their skills and will be trained to operate the machines.

70,"From waiting tables to picking out medicine, robots are transforming the way people work. NTU researchers are even perfecting a robot that tutors primary school children.  SINGAPORE: More companies are looking to using robots to take over tasks traditionally performed by workers. This can help improve productivity and address the issue of manpower shortage.  Researchers from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have envisioned that in schools of the future, robots will be able to guide children in their lessons, so that teachers will have more time to observe students behaviour and identify their needs.  ""Imagine we are putting a more structured curriculum into the robot to help tutor the lower primary school kids, like those in P1, P2 - a companion robot to help them go through their curriculum, explained Dr Chen I-Ming, director of NTUs Robotics Research Centre.  The researchers have come up with a prototype that it has tested in some kindergartens. The project is funded by the Singapore Millennium Fund, a foundation supported by Temasek Trust.  Children would be able to control the movements of the robots using sensors. Teachers can also benefit, by doing voice recordings of stories using the robots and playing them back to the students.    For teachers, it also means picking up a new skill. ""I have some problems because I'm not very familiar (with it), said Ms Leela Chua, a teacher with Youth Progress Singapore. Teachers should be open. It's lifelong learning - we should always look forward to something new, something up to date.""  Dr Chen said that since 2013, more companies have shown an interest in robotics, and have approached the university to enquire about collaborations.    ""It's actually different from sector to sector. If you are in manufacturing sectors, their main goal is to improve productivity. If it's anything that really improves productivity, they will take it up immediately, said Dr Chen. But for other social or educational types of robots, they need to go through a lengthy case study, or test-bedding and also prove the results. That will probably take a bit much longer. You still need probably two to three years at least.    Robot waiter Techi can work long hours, deliver food and drinks to customers and even take the lift to hand over toiletries to hotel guests. The company behind the robot said more than 10 firms will be using it from March.    ""Our aim is to replace the repeated, tiring jobs for human beings, so that they can concentrate more on the productive work, said Techmetics chairman and technical director Mathan Muthupillai. If you talk about the F&B side, waiters are spending more time on actually taking the items and delivering them to the table - that work can be actually taken care of by the robot.    Mr Neelendra Jain, founder and CEO of food and beverage solutions provider The Happy Roots, said with non-skilled tasks being diverted to robots, staff will be able to focus on work which would require their skills.    At KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, a robotic bottle-dispensing system was rolled out in 2015. It can load, pick, assemble and label medicine bottles. Before the medicine is dispensed to patients, pharmacy staff will perform an additional round of checks.  This replaces many of the manual tasks involved, saving around 8,760 man-hours a year. Previously, staff had to manually pick, pack, assemble, barcode, and track expiry dates and batch numbers, across various types of bottled medication.    At first, me and my colleagues were a bit apprehensive about operating the machines as we didn't know what to expect, whether the machines will be beneficial for us, said Ms Hamidah Rahmat, a senior pharmacy technician at KKH. But after a while, the vendors, the engineers taught us how to operate the machines. They taught us how to troubleshoot. After practice, after getting used to it, now we are more confident.""    Ms Hamidah also said workers should not be worried about robots taking over their jobs, but that they should see them as helpers to improve efficiency and customer service.",2016-01-18,SINGAPORE: More companies are looking to using robots to take over ...

71,"EXCLUSIVE: Singapore researchers are testing robotic swans that could provide essential, highly advanced water testing in reservoirs around the country and the world.  SINGAPORE: Floating on the surface of Pandan Reservoir in Singapores south west are what researchers hope will be the future of cheap, real-time water quality testing.  Developed by a team at the National University of Singapore (NUS), in conjunction with the national water agency PUB, the NUSwan utilises advanced water monitoring technology, fitted into the shell that closely resembles a living, breathing bird.  We started with a number of smaller bird models, before we decided on the swan. Its just the right size, said Assistant Professor Mandar Chitre, one of the projects lead researchers. If you look at it in the environment, it just looks like a swan swimming around.  A small team at the NUS Environmental Research Institute, working with the Tropical Marine Science Institute, initially conceptualised the robot back in 2010 but only began their first series of test bedding last year.  The aim is to mobilise the robotic swans to monitor different physical and biological compounds in fresh water, including pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and chlorophyll, which are common indicators used to determine if there are problems in a water source.  At present, water authorities face the logistical challenge of physically having to collect samples from large bodies of water, normally using a boat. It is an approach that requires time and manpower and restricts the speed at which officials can act in the case of an outbreak or a contamination.  It would be expensive to do similar monitoring manually or using AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), said Asst Prof Chitre. Hence to reduce reliance on manpower and increase efficiency in water quality monitoring, we are constantly looking into developing new technology with improved capabilities.  Scientifically, the NUSwan test drives a new paradigm of freshwater monitoring, one that is persistent and interactive, and is potentially able to sample the dynamics of water quality over space and time at improved resolution at an affordable cost, he added.  The swans work by trawling particular areas of interest in a water body and wirelessly sending back data through cloud computing. Programmers will be able to remotely control the robots, but the aim is to ensure they are as autonomous as possible, requiring just basic monitoring and operation, which can happen from anywhere with an internet connection.  The researchers said the swans navigation is more advanced than an automatic vacuum cleaner for instance, which can avoid obstacles but cannot tell where it has already travelled. The SWAN uses GPS to ensure it does not duplicate its monitoring efforts, unless programmed to.  They are durable enough such that even if a recreational water user such as a kayaker, or even a small boat, hits the swan, it will not be damaged, according to the teams behind the technology.  They believe they are at just the tip of realising the potential of this system and have designed the NUSwan to be adaptable to various environmental challenges that may arise.  The NUSwan platform is designed to be extendable  new sensors and actuators can be added on demand to increase its sensing capability, said Mr Koay Teong Beng, one of the other leading researchers on the project.  Already the team is collaborating with other university researchers to combine technologies and stretch the swans to their technological limits.  This includes a highly sensitive freshwater phosphate sensor, which is being developed independently by a separate NUS team. Phosphates are key nutrients in the development of blue-green algal blooms, which can be devastating for water sources.  There is a hope that technology such as the phosphate sensor could be mobilised by the NUSwan, and provide a real-world alarm system to the threat of algal blooms, a common problem encountered in more polluted waterways as a result of fertilisers, sewerage and domestic waste.  Earlier this year, a proliferation of algal blooms in oxygen-depleted, bacteria-rich waters caused thousands of fish to die. While the phosphate sensor has only been tested in fresh water, it is this kind of scenario that it is designed to help prevent.  Phosphate detection was lacking; phosphate sensors are not available in the market, said Lanry Yung, Associate Professor of Chemical and Bio-molecule Engineering . The prototype is finished. Now we are trying to do automation and collaboration with the NUSwan team to work on hardware.  Salt complicates the process, but nonetheless its something to look into at the next stage, he said.  The NUSwan has received interest from water authorities across the region, particularly in China where water pollution is a pressing issue and where the system will be tested on several rivers in the south of the country. That could potentially see the robotic swans floating on some of the worlds largest water reservoirs in the near future.  We see the potential of having NUSwans deployed in urban freshwater bodies and coastal water beyond Singapore. With the data stored in the cloud, collaborators may share and aggregate data and understand global phenomena, Asst Prof Chitre said.",2015-07-03,"EXCLUSIVE: Singapore researchers are testing robotic swans that could provide essential, highly advanced water testing in reservoirs around ...",Robot swans bring new advanced technology to water testing,http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/robot-swans-bring-new/1958380.html
72,"Every six months, the pieces of silicon glue used on a fan cover of an aircraft engine need to be replaced.  A worker takes eight to 12 hours to complete the tedious task. But a robot does it in four hours.  Such industrial robots are increasingly being used on the factory floor, prompting the introduction of a new training programme.  Announced yesterday, its aim is to train more than 2,000 professionals, managers, executives and technicians in the next two years to operate and implement automated production systems.  The training will be done by the Robotics Application Centre of Excellence (Race), a collaboration between professors from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and local precision engineering company PBA Group.  Said Race chief executive Derrick Yap: ""South-east Asia has been earmarked to be the factory of the world and Singapore, being at the epicentre of the region, is very well-positioned (to take advantage of this).""  The series of courses under the new Robotics Applications Training and Education Programme starts on Jan 11, with a one-day ""novice"" level session for people without any technical background in robotics and automation. They will learn about technology trends and how to analyse the cost-effectiveness of adopting robotics and automation. The session costs $50 for Singaporeans, after subsidies.  The next two higher-level courses, each to run for five days, will be launched in March, with another two to follow later.  Mr Gilbert Tan, chief executive of the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), urged firms and industries to prepare for the future and adopt more advanced technology in manufacturing. His institute has signed an agreement with Race and Workforce Singapore to develop skills training and support employers in staff development.  Race will also team up with the Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association and e2i, to help its members learn about technology and buy more of it.  Yesterday, Race held a session on it for about 40 company officials.  ASTech managing director Mun Kok Woh, whose robotics solutions company employs 12 people, said it is costly for his more experienced staff to stop work to train new hires.

73,"With Singapore's rapidly-ageing population, there will be more seniors needing care in future, but not enough carers to do the job.  This is why hospitals are turning to robots and other assistive technology to ease the burden on the manpower-strapped sector.  Instead of a nurse checking every 15 minutes for six hours, to see if a patient who has had a cathether inserted is bleeding, a special blood-sensitive ""bandage"" can do the job, freeing the nurse for six hours of more fulfilling work.  A robot, not a therapist, can help recovering stroke patients exercise; another can keep early stage dementia patients occupied and alert them to take their medicine, or to call for a helper when it senses that they are struggling to get up.  Call it Changi General Hospital's answer to the labour crunch. This technology can become mainstream within the next few years.     President Tony Tan looks at a Interactive Robot for Telemedicine during the opening of the new Integrated Building at Changi General Hospital on 23 July, 2015.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG     Dr Chionh Chang Yin, who heads Renal Medicine at CGH, plans to trial the blood-sensitive bandages designed by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) later this year.  If it works as well as expected, it can be used not only for dialysis patients, but also heart patients who have had a stent put in, or had to do an angiogram to check the heart.  Bleeding from the puncture hole is rare, said Dr Chionh, but should it happen, a patient can bleed to death if not treated imediately. The SUTD device can tell blood from other fluids, and will set off an alarm if it senses one millilitre of blood.     Health Minister Gan Kim Yong looks at a HOSPI Autonomous Delivery Robot during the opening of the new Integrated Building at Changi General Hospital on 23 July, 2015.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG     The idea for the Centre for Healthcare Assitive and Robotics Technology (Chart), started early last year and launched by President Tony Tan on Thursday (July 23), was triggered by the visit of a team from Japan in 2012 wanting to know if there was a market for such products.  Dr Lee Chien Earn, CGH's Chief Executive Officer, said some technology might be great, but not what patients or hospitals want. So CGH decided to work with industry on what it needs instead.  ""It's better to create solutions to meet needs,"" he said. ""The user must be involved from the start.""  The technology does not have to be new, he said. It can be something used in other industries that can be adapted to healthcare needs.  Examples that are now being tweaked to fit healthcare settings include automated guided vehicles (AGV) used in warehouses. The unit can carry shelves holding food, linen or files, or move heavy items like beds. All it needs is a map of the hospital to find its way around.  The idea is to ""take the manual out of healthcare"", said Chart's director Ms Selina Seah, adding that it is increasingly hard to find people to fill jobs like porters.  A team from the Nanyang Technological University took six months to convert an industrial robotic arm to pick and pack a range of objects, including fragile items.  Ms Seah said the robot arm can work non-stop and do the job without mistakes, unlike people who get tired and could become careless.  Dr Tan said Chart provides a platform for research institutes, companies and healthcare practitioners to collaborate in the development of new, impactful healthcare delivery solutions.  He revealed that Chart will be part of the National Robotics Programme. The Government will release details later this year of this multi-agency initiative to test-bed robotic technologies across various sectors, he said.

74,"When she got married 10 years ago, Ms Pranoti Nagarkar Israni, co-founder of automatic roti- maker Rotimatic, would painstakingly make chapati, an Indian flat bread, for her husband.  The time-consuming and tedious task of kneading the dough and slaving behind the stove every day got her thinking of developing an automatic roti-maker.  As it turned out, she and her husband Rishi Israni, both 34 and graduates from the National University of Singapore, were perfectly suited to the task.  Ms Nagarkar is a mechanical engineer, while Mr Rishi is a computer science graduate who ran his own mobile security company. So, she took charge of figuring out the mechanics of the roti-maker, while he figured out the software technology.  The India-born Singapore citizens, who have a three-year-old son, started Zimplistic in 2008. Eight years later, the company's first and only product, the Rotimatic, has finally been shipped to its first batch of customers. They had placed orders in 2014.  The robotic roti-maker received special mention in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech last Sunday.  1. Plug in the Rotimatic and switch it on. It takes three to four minutes to heat up. Meanwhile, fill the compartments with flour, oil and water. 2. On the touchscreen, select the number of roti required, the thickness, roast level and amount of oil (one or two drops for each roti). Press the start button. 3. The machine will start to churn out a ball of dough from the flour, oil and water. If the dough is not formed properly, an error message will appear and the dough can be removed by opening the side door to the machine. The dough-making will then resume. 4. Once the dough is formed, a lever pushes it onto a hot pan to cook. The dough is flattened into a disc and it puffs up while cooking . When the first roti is being cooked, the machine will start kneading the dough for the next one. 5. Once cooked, the roti is pushed out onto the attached (removable) tray. It is best eaten hot with curry, as a wrap with filling or as a dessert crepe. 6. The machine can make up to 20 roti in less than 30 minutes. If there is not enough flour, water or oil in the containers, the machine will prompt the user to add more ingredients. 7. To clean the Rotimatic, the ingredient containers and parts used for the kneading of the dough can be removed for washing. When cool, the hot pan (not removable) can be wiped clean.  Watch how the Rotimatic works at str.sg/4cGh  When speaking on promoting entrepreneurship, he cited it as one of the success stories from start-up hot spot Block 71 in Ayer Rajah Crescent. It is run by the JTC Corporation and is part of the JTC LaunchPad programme, which provides a nurturing environment for start-ups.  Zimplistic's office is now located in Commonwealth Lane.  The machine can make up to 20 cooked roti in under 30 minutes, using only whole wheat flour, oil and water.  Users select the thickness of the roti, roast level, amount of oil and number of roti required, and press a button to start the process.  Each Rotimatic is priced at US$999 (S$1,351). It is made in Malaysia, weighs 18kg and is about the size of a microwave oven.  Pre-orders for the next batch of machines are likely to open next month, says Ms Nagarkar, but deliveries may be made only in the first quarter of next year, as the company is now shipping machines to customers in the United States who pre-ordered them.  Shipment has been completed for the ""few hundred"" Singapore orders.  Within five days of launching pre-orders in the US and Singapore in June 2014, the company received more than 8,000 orders.  Ms Nagarkar says customers were updated via e-mail about the progress and were allowed to request refunds at any time. Seven per cent of customers who preordered asked for refunds, she adds.  On the challenges faced at the beginning, she says: ""Many people thought the Rotimatic was a crazy idea. Building a team and getting investors were tough. We needed to raise money and credibility.""  To build buzz, she took part in the Start-Up @Singapore Business Plan Competition in 2009 and won the top prize of $40,000 for the Rotimatic.  The following year, the company got its first seed funding of US$400,000 from angel investors. In 2012, Zimplistic received US$3 million from private investors and, in July last year, another US$11.5 million of funding was received from venture capital firm NSI Ventures and global engineering giant Robert Bosch GMbH.  Calling the eight years it took to perfect the Rotimatic a ""humbling experience"", she says: ""We took time to stabilise the system, to make sure every roti is consistent. For the past two years, we would make 2,000 roti daily in the office, to test the reliability of the machine.""  Of course, the Rotimatic is not perfect. Currently, it can work with only one brand of flour - Aashirvaad whole wheat flour - which can be bought online at www.myonlinegroceries.com. It costs $2 for a 1kg bag.  If the ball of dough rolled out is not ""perfect"", the machine will alert users to discard the dough before churning out another batch.  Ms Nagarkar says: ""For the first batch of machines that we have sent out, perhaps the first five roti may not be great. It is also a learning path for the machine.""  There are plans to upgrade the software so users can make other types of flat breads and add ingredients such as herbs and spices to the dough.  The smart flat bread-maker is programmed to enable software upgrades over the cloud and remote troubleshooting via an app.  This will also allow users to get recipes from Zimplistic's in-house chef, who was initially hired to provide meals for the 85 office staff. The chef now helps in product development.  Ms Nagarkar hopes to sell the Rotimatic to other countries such as India, as well as in the Middle East and Britain.  The product will be sold exclusively online - she has no plans to sell it in supermarkets or department stores. However, she does not rule out doing product demonstrations for consumers to understand how the machine works.  On the hefty price tag, she says the Rotimatic - with its smart functions and cooking abilities - is unlike other kitchen appliances.  She says: ""The making of roti - it's the same amount of hassle and pain required when washing clothes with your hands. When you have a washing machine, you realise how much time it saves you.  ""Rotimatic is similar, in terms of saving you time and tedious labour. And you get a cooked product at the end of it.""

79,"The robot, PictoBot, can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.  SINGAPORE: A spray-painting robot could halve the number of workers needed to paint walls at industrial developments, do the job 25 per cent faster and improve safety, announced Nanyang Technological University (NTU), JTC and the National Research Foundation (NRF) on Wednesday (Oct 26).  Industrial buildings come with high ceilings to accommodate bulky equipment and materials. Currently, the conventional method for spray painting requires a team of two painters using a scissor lift to reach the high ceilings.  ""Working at such heights exposes painters to various safety risks,"" they said.  In comparison, the 1.5-tonne PictoBot needs only one human supervisor on ground level. Using its optical camera and laser scanner, the robot can navigate and paint walls up to 10 metres high with its robotic arm.  PictoBot can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.     It can also work four hours on one battery charge, giving walls an even coat of paint that matches industry standards. It can even operate in the dark, the organisations added.  These features allow the robot to paint continuously day or night, improving efficiency and freeing up manpower.  Developed in a year at NTU's Robotic Research Centre, the project is supported under NRF's Test-Bedding and Demonstration of Innovative Research funding initiative which aims to use Government-led demand efforts to demonstrate feasibility of innovative technologies and catalyse adoption by private sectors.  To ensure that PictoBot meets industry standards, its developers said it will be tested at industrial developments such as JTC Space @ Gul.  JTC Director of Innovation Programme Office and Corporate Planning Anil Das said that such robotic solutions help improve the productivity of the construction industry.  ""Developers can go to market a lot faster and industry players can continue with us to develop even more innovative solutions to alleviate some of the construction productivity challenges that we face today,"" he said.  As for how jobs in the future will be affected by autonomous robots, NTU Robotic Research Centre Director Professor Chen I-Ming said workers will be able to upgrade their skills and will be trained to operate the machines.

80,"From waiting tables to picking out medicine, robots are transforming the way people work. NTU researchers are even perfecting a robot that tutors primary school children.  SINGAPORE: More companies are looking to using robots to take over tasks traditionally performed by workers. This can help improve productivity and address the issue of manpower shortage.  Researchers from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have envisioned that in schools of the future, robots will be able to guide children in their lessons, so that teachers will have more time to observe students behaviour and identify their needs.  ""Imagine we are putting a more structured curriculum into the robot to help tutor the lower primary school kids, like those in P1, P2 - a companion robot to help them go through their curriculum, explained Dr Chen I-Ming, director of NTUs Robotics Research Centre.  The researchers have come up with a prototype that it has tested in some kindergartens. The project is funded by the Singapore Millennium Fund, a foundation supported by Temasek Trust.  Children would be able to control the movements of the robots using sensors. Teachers can also benefit, by doing voice recordings of stories using the robots and playing them back to the students.    For teachers, it also means picking up a new skill. ""I have some problems because I'm not very familiar (with it), said Ms Leela Chua, a teacher with Youth Progress Singapore. Teachers should be open. It's lifelong learning - we should always look forward to something new, something up to date.""  Dr Chen said that since 2013, more companies have shown an interest in robotics, and have approached the university to enquire about collaborations.    ""It's actually different from sector to sector. If you are in manufacturing sectors, their main goal is to improve productivity. If it's anything that really improves productivity, they will take it up immediately, said Dr Chen. But for other social or educational types of robots, they need to go through a lengthy case study, or test-bedding and also prove the results. That will probably take a bit much longer. You still need probably two to three years at least.    Robot waiter Techi can work long hours, deliver food and drinks to customers and even take the lift to hand over toiletries to hotel guests. The company behind the robot said more than 10 firms will be using it from March.    ""Our aim is to replace the repeated, tiring jobs for human beings, so that they can concentrate more on the productive work, said Techmetics chairman and technical director Mathan Muthupillai. If you talk about the F&B side, waiters are spending more time on actually taking the items and delivering them to the table - that work can be actually taken care of by the robot.    Mr Neelendra Jain, founder and CEO of food and beverage solutions provider The Happy Roots, said with non-skilled tasks being diverted to robots, staff will be able to focus on work which would require their skills.    At KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, a robotic bottle-dispensing system was rolled out in 2015. It can load, pick, assemble and label medicine bottles. Before the medicine is dispensed to patients, pharmacy staff will perform an additional round of checks.  This replaces many of the manual tasks involved, saving around 8,760 man-hours a year. Previously, staff had to manually pick, pack, assemble, barcode, and track expiry dates and batch numbers, across various types of bottled medication.    At first, me and my colleagues were a bit apprehensive about operating the machines as we didn't know what to expect, whether the machines will be beneficial for us, said Ms Hamidah Rahmat, a senior pharmacy technician at KKH. But after a while, the vendors, the engineers taught us how to operate the machines. They taught us how to troubleshoot. After practice, after getting used to it, now we are more confident.""

81,"EXCLUSIVE: Singapore researchers are testing robotic swans that could provide essential, highly advanced water testing in reservoirs around the country and the world.  SINGAPORE: Floating on the surface of Pandan Reservoir in Singapores south west are what researchers hope will be the future of cheap, real-time water quality testing.  Developed by a team at the National University of Singapore (NUS), in conjunction with the national water agency PUB, the NUSwan utilises advanced water monitoring technology, fitted into the shell that closely resembles a living, breathing bird.  We started with a number of smaller bird models, before we decided on the swan. Its just the right size, said Assistant Professor Mandar Chitre, one of the projects lead researchers. If you look at it in the environment, it just looks like a swan swimming around.  A small team at the NUS Environmental Research Institute, working with the Tropical Marine Science Institute, initially conceptualised the robot back in 2010 but only began their first series of test bedding last year.  The aim is to mobilise the robotic swans to monitor different physical and biological compounds in fresh water, including pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and chlorophyll, which are common indicators used to determine if there are problems in a water source.  At present, water authorities face the logistical challenge of physically having to collect samples from large bodies of water, normally using a boat. It is an approach that requires time and manpower and restricts the speed at which officials can act in the case of an outbreak or a contamination.  It would be expensive to do similar monitoring manually or using AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), said Asst Prof Chitre. Hence to reduce reliance on manpower and increase efficiency in water quality monitoring, we are constantly looking into developing new technology with improved capabilities.  Scientifically, the NUSwan test drives a new paradigm of freshwater monitoring, one that is persistent and interactive, and is potentially able to sample the dynamics of water quality over space and time at improved resolution at an affordable cost, he added.  The swans work by trawling particular areas of interest in a water body and wirelessly sending back data through cloud computing. Programmers will be able to remotely control the robots, but the aim is to ensure they are as autonomous as possible, requiring just basic monitoring and operation, which can happen from anywhere with an internet connection.  The researchers said the swans navigation is more advanced than an automatic vacuum cleaner for instance, which can avoid obstacles but cannot tell where it has already travelled. The SWAN uses GPS to ensure it does not duplicate its monitoring efforts, unless programmed to.  They are durable enough such that even if a recreational water user such as a kayaker, or even a small boat, hits the swan, it will not be damaged, according to the teams behind the technology.  They believe they are at just the tip of realising the potential of this system and have designed the NUSwan to be adaptable to various environmental challenges that may arise.  The NUSwan platform is designed to be extendable  new sensors and actuators can be added on demand to increase its sensing capability, said Mr Koay Teong Beng, one of the other leading researchers on the project.  Already the team is collaborating with other university researchers to combine technologies and stretch the swans to their technological limits.  This includes a highly sensitive freshwater phosphate sensor, which is being developed independently by a separate NUS team. Phosphates are key nutrients in the development of blue-green algal blooms, which can be devastating for water sources.  There is a hope that technology such as the phosphate sensor could be mobilised by the NUSwan, and provide a real-world alarm system to the threat of algal blooms, a common problem encountered in more polluted waterways as a result of fertilisers, sewerage and domestic waste.  Earlier this year, a proliferation of algal blooms in oxygen-depleted, bacteria-rich waters caused thousands of fish to die. While the phosphate sensor has only been tested in fresh water, it is this kind of scenario that it is designed to help prevent.  Phosphate detection was lacking; phosphate sensors are not available in the market, said Lanry Yung, Associate Professor of Chemical and Bio-molecule Engineering . The prototype is finished. Now we are trying to do automation and collaboration with the NUSwan team to work on hardware.  Salt complicates the process, but nonetheless its something to look into at the next stage, he said.  The NUSwan has received interest from water authorities across the region, particularly in China where water pollution is a pressing issue and where the system will be tested on several rivers in the south of the country. That could potentially see the robotic swans floating on some of the worlds largest water reservoirs in the near future.  We see the potential of having NUSwans deployed in urban freshwater bodies and coastal water beyond Singapore. With the data stored in the cloud, collaborators may share and aggregate data and understand global phenomena, Asst Prof Chitre said.",2015-07-03,"EXCLUSIVE: Singapore researchers are testing robotic swans that could provide essential, highly advanced water testing in reservoirs around ...",Robot swans bring new advanced technology to water testing,http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/robot-swans-bring-new/1958380.html
82,"Every six months, the pieces of silicon glue used on a fan cover of an aircraft engine need to be replaced.  A worker takes eight to 12 hours to complete the tedious task. But a robot does it in four hours.  Such industrial robots are increasingly being used on the factory floor, prompting the introduction of a new training programme.  Announced yesterday, its aim is to train more than 2,000 professionals, managers, executives and technicians in the next two years to operate and implement automated production systems.  The training will be done by the Robotics Application Centre of Excellence (Race), a collaboration between professors from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and local precision engineering company PBA Group.  Said Race chief executive Derrick Yap: ""South-east Asia has been earmarked to be the factory of the world and Singapore, being at the epicentre of the region, is very well-positioned (to take advantage of this).""  The series of courses under the new Robotics Applications Training and Education Programme starts on Jan 11, with a one-day ""novice"" level session for people without any technical background in robotics and automation. They will learn about technology trends and how to analyse the cost-effectiveness of adopting robotics and automation. The session costs $50 for Singaporeans, after subsidies.  The next two higher-level courses, each to run for five days, will be launched in March, with another two to follow later.  Mr Gilbert Tan, chief executive of the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), urged firms and industries to prepare for the future and adopt more advanced technology in manufacturing. His institute has signed an agreement with Race and Workforce Singapore to develop skills training and support employers in staff development.  Race will also team up with the Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association and e2i, to help its members learn about technology and buy more of it.  Yesterday, Race held a session on it for about 40 company officials.  ASTech managing director Mun Kok Woh, whose robotics solutions company employs 12 people, said it is costly for his more experienced staff to stop work to train new hires.

83,"With Singapore's rapidly-ageing population, there will be more seniors needing care in future, but not enough carers to do the job.  This is why hospitals are turning to robots and other assistive technology to ease the burden on the manpower-strapped sector.  Instead of a nurse checking every 15 minutes for six hours, to see if a patient who has had a cathether inserted is bleeding, a special blood-sensitive ""bandage"" can do the job, freeing the nurse for six hours of more fulfilling work.  A robot, not a therapist, can help recovering stroke patients exercise; another can keep early stage dementia patients occupied and alert them to take their medicine, or to call for a helper when it senses that they are struggling to get up.  Call it Changi General Hospital's answer to the labour crunch. This technology can become mainstream within the next few years.     President Tony Tan looks at a Interactive Robot for Telemedicine during the opening of the new Integrated Building at Changi General Hospital on 23 July, 2015.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG     Dr Chionh Chang Yin, who heads Renal Medicine at CGH, plans to trial the blood-sensitive bandages designed by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) later this year.  If it works as well as expected, it can be used not only for dialysis patients, but also heart patients who have had a stent put in, or had to do an angiogram to check the heart.  Bleeding from the puncture hole is rare, said Dr Chionh, but should it happen, a patient can bleed to death if not treated imediately. The SUTD device can tell blood from other fluids, and will set off an alarm if it senses one millilitre of blood.     Health Minister Gan Kim Yong looks at a HOSPI Autonomous Delivery Robot during the opening of the new Integrated Building at Changi General Hospital on 23 July, 2015.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG     The idea for the Centre for Healthcare Assitive and Robotics Technology (Chart), started early last year and launched by President Tony Tan on Thursday (July 23), was triggered by the visit of a team from Japan in 2012 wanting to know if there was a market for such products.  Dr Lee Chien Earn, CGH's Chief Executive Officer, said some technology might be great, but not what patients or hospitals want. So CGH decided to work with industry on what it needs instead.  ""It's better to create solutions to meet needs,"" he said. ""The user must be involved from the start.""  The technology does not have to be new, he said. It can be something used in other industries that can be adapted to healthcare needs.  Examples that are now being tweaked to fit healthcare settings include automated guided vehicles (AGV) used in warehouses. The unit can carry shelves holding food, linen or files, or move heavy items like beds. All it needs is a map of the hospital to find its way around.  The idea is to ""take the manual out of healthcare"", said Chart's director Ms Selina Seah, adding that it is increasingly hard to find people to fill jobs like porters.  A team from the Nanyang Technological University took six months to convert an industrial robotic arm to pick and pack a range of objects, including fragile items.  Ms Seah said the robot arm can work non-stop and do the job without mistakes, unlike people who get tired and could become careless.  Dr Tan said Chart provides a platform for research institutes, companies and healthcare practitioners to collaborate in the development of new, impactful healthcare delivery solutions.  He revealed that Chart will be part of the National Robotics Programme. The Government will release details later this year of this multi-agency initiative to test-bed robotic technologies across various sectors, he said.

84,"When she got married 10 years ago, Ms Pranoti Nagarkar Israni, co-founder of automatic roti- maker Rotimatic, would painstakingly make chapati, an Indian flat bread, for her husband.  The time-consuming and tedious task of kneading the dough and slaving behind the stove every day got her thinking of developing an automatic roti-maker.  As it turned out, she and her husband Rishi Israni, both 34 and graduates from the National University of Singapore, were perfectly suited to the task.  Ms Nagarkar is a mechanical engineer, while Mr Rishi is a computer science graduate who ran his own mobile security company. So, she took charge of figuring out the mechanics of the roti-maker, while he figured out the software technology.  The India-born Singapore citizens, who have a three-year-old son, started Zimplistic in 2008. Eight years later, the company's first and only product, the Rotimatic, has finally been shipped to its first batch of customers. They had placed orders in 2014.  The robotic roti-maker received special mention in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech last Sunday.  1. Plug in the Rotimatic and switch it on. It takes three to four minutes to heat up. Meanwhile, fill the compartments with flour, oil and water. 2. On the touchscreen, select the number of roti required, the thickness, roast level and amount of oil (one or two drops for each roti). Press the start button. 3. The machine will start to churn out a ball of dough from the flour, oil and water. If the dough is not formed properly, an error message will appear and the dough can be removed by opening the side door to the machine. The dough-making will then resume. 4. Once the dough is formed, a lever pushes it onto a hot pan to cook. The dough is flattened into a disc and it puffs up while cooking . When the first roti is being cooked, the machine will start kneading the dough for the next one. 5. Once cooked, the roti is pushed out onto the attached (removable) tray. It is best eaten hot with curry, as a wrap with filling or as a dessert crepe. 6. The machine can make up to 20 roti in less than 30 minutes. If there is not enough flour, water or oil in the containers, the machine will prompt the user to add more ingredients. 7. To clean the Rotimatic, the ingredient containers and parts used for the kneading of the dough can be removed for washing. When cool, the hot pan (not removable) can be wiped clean.  Watch how the Rotimatic works at str.sg/4cGh  When speaking on promoting entrepreneurship, he cited it as one of the success stories from start-up hot spot Block 71 in Ayer Rajah Crescent. It is run by the JTC Corporation and is part of the JTC LaunchPad programme, which provides a nurturing environment for start-ups.  Zimplistic's office is now located in Commonwealth Lane.  The machine can make up to 20 cooked roti in under 30 minutes, using only whole wheat flour, oil and water.  Users select the thickness of the roti, roast level, amount of oil and number of roti required, and press a button to start the process.  Each Rotimatic is priced at US$999 (S$1,351). It is made in Malaysia, weighs 18kg and is about the size of a microwave oven.  Pre-orders for the next batch of machines are likely to open next month, says Ms Nagarkar, but deliveries may be made only in the first quarter of next year, as the company is now shipping machines to customers in the United States who pre-ordered them.  Shipment has been completed for the ""few hundred"" Singapore orders.  Within five days of launching pre-orders in the US and Singapore in June 2014, the company received more than 8,000 orders.  Ms Nagarkar says customers were updated via e-mail about the progress and were allowed to request refunds at any time. Seven per cent of customers who preordered asked for refunds, she adds.  On the challenges faced at the beginning, she says: ""Many people thought the Rotimatic was a crazy idea. Building a team and getting investors were tough. We needed to raise money and credibility.""  To build buzz, she took part in the Start-Up @Singapore Business Plan Competition in 2009 and won the top prize of $40,000 for the Rotimatic.  The following year, the company got its first seed funding of US$400,000 from angel investors. In 2012, Zimplistic received US$3 million from private investors and, in July last year, another US$11.5 million of funding was received from venture capital firm NSI Ventures and global engineering giant Robert Bosch GMbH.  Calling the eight years it took to perfect the Rotimatic a ""humbling experience"", she says: ""We took time to stabilise the system, to make sure every roti is consistent. For the past two years, we would make 2,000 roti daily in the office, to test the reliability of the machine.""  Of course, the Rotimatic is not perfect. Currently, it can work with only one brand of flour - Aashirvaad whole wheat flour - which can be bought online at www.myonlinegroceries.com. It costs $2 for a 1kg bag.  If the ball of dough rolled out is not ""perfect"", the machine will alert users to discard the dough before churning out another batch.  Ms Nagarkar says: ""For the first batch of machines that we have sent out, perhaps the first five roti may not be great. It is also a learning path for the machine.""  There are plans to upgrade the software so users can make other types of flat breads and add ingredients such as herbs and spices to the dough.  The smart flat bread-maker is programmed to enable software upgrades over the cloud and remote troubleshooting via an app.  This will also allow users to get recipes from Zimplistic's in-house chef, who was initially hired to provide meals for the 85 office staff. The chef now helps in product development.  Ms Nagarkar hopes to sell the Rotimatic to other countries such as India, as well as in the Middle East and Britain.  The product will be sold exclusively online - she has no plans to sell it in supermarkets or department stores. However, she does not rule out doing product demonstrations for consumers to understand how the machine works.  On the hefty price tag, she says the Rotimatic - with its smart functions and cooking abilities - is unlike other kitchen appliances.  She says: ""The making of roti - it's the same amount of hassle and pain required when washing clothes with your hands. When you have a washing machine, you realise how much time it saves you.  ""Rotimatic is similar, in terms of saving you time and tedious labour. And you get a cooked product at the end of it.""

89,"The robot, PictoBot, can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.  SINGAPORE: A spray-painting robot could halve the number of workers needed to paint walls at industrial developments, do the job 25 per cent faster and improve safety, announced Nanyang Technological University (NTU), JTC and the National Research Foundation (NRF) on Wednesday (Oct 26).  Industrial buildings come with high ceilings to accommodate bulky equipment and materials. Currently, the conventional method for spray painting requires a team of two painters using a scissor lift to reach the high ceilings.  ""Working at such heights exposes painters to various safety risks,"" they said.  In comparison, the 1.5-tonne PictoBot needs only one human supervisor on ground level. Using its optical camera and laser scanner, the robot can navigate and paint walls up to 10 metres high with its robotic arm.  PictoBot can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.     It can also work four hours on one battery charge, giving walls an even coat of paint that matches industry standards. It can even operate in the dark, the organisations added.  These features allow the robot to paint continuously day or night, improving efficiency and freeing up manpower.  Developed in a year at NTU's Robotic Research Centre, the project is supported under NRF's Test-Bedding and Demonstration of Innovative Research funding initiative which aims to use Government-led demand efforts to demonstrate feasibility of innovative technologies and catalyse adoption by private sectors.

If it's anything that really improves productivity, they will take it up immediately, said Dr Chen. But for other social or educational types of robots, they need to go through a lengthy case study, or test-bedding and also prove the results. That will probably take a bit much longer. You still need probably two to three years at least.    Robot waiter Techi can work long hours, deliver food and drinks to customers and even take the lift to hand over toiletries to hotel guests. The company behind the robot said more than 10 firms will be using it from March.    ""Our aim is to replace the repeated, tiring jobs for human beings, so that they can concentrate more on the productive work, said Techmetics chairman and technical director Mathan Muthupillai. If you talk about the F&B side, waiters are spending more time on actually taking the items and delivering them to the table - that work can be actually taken care of by the robot.    Mr Neelendra Jain, founder and CEO of food and beverage solutions provider The Happy Roots, said with non-skilled tasks being diverted to robots, staff will be able to focus on work which would require their skills.    At KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, a robotic bottle-dispensing system was rolled out in 2015. It can load, pick, assemble and label medicine bottles. Before the medicine is dispensed to patients, pharmacy staff will perform an additional round of checks.  This replaces many of the manual tasks involved, saving around 8,760 man-hours a year. Previously, staff had to manually pick, pack, assemble, barcode, and track expiry dates and batch numbers, across various types of bottled medication.    At first, me and my colleagues were a bit apprehensive about operating the machines as we didn't know what to expect, whether the machines will be beneficial for us, said Ms Hamidah Rahmat, a senior pharmacy technician at KKH. But after a while, the vendors, the engineers taught us how to operate the machines. They taught us how to troubleshoot. After practice, after getting used to it, now we are more confident.""    Ms Hamidah also said workers should not be worried about robots taking over their jobs, but that they should see them as helpers to improve efficiency and customer service.",2016-01-18,SINGAPORE: More companies are looking to using robots to take over ...

91,"EXCLUSIVE: Singapore researchers are testing robotic swans that could provide essential, highly advanced water testing in reservoirs around the country and the world.  SINGAPORE: Floating on the surface of Pandan Reservoir in Singapores south west are what researchers hope will be the future of cheap, real-time water quality testing.  Developed by a team at the National University of Singapore (NUS), in conjunction with the national water agency PUB, the NUSwan utilises advanced water monitoring technology, fitted into the shell that closely resembles a living, breathing bird.  We started with a number of smaller bird models, before we decided on the swan. Its just the right size, said Assistant Professor Mandar Chitre, one of the projects lead researchers. If you look at it in the environment, it just looks like a swan swimming around.  A small team at the NUS Environmental Research Institute, working with the Tropical Marine Science Institute, initially conceptualised the robot back in 2010 but only began their first series of test bedding last year.  The aim is to mobilise the robotic swans to monitor different physical and biological compounds in fresh water, including pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and chlorophyll, which are common indicators used to determine if there are problems in a water source.  At present, water authorities face the logistical challenge of physically having to collect samples from large bodies of water, normally using a boat. It is an approach that requires time and manpower and restricts the speed at which officials can act in the case of an outbreak or a contamination.  It would be expensive to do similar monitoring manually or using AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), said Asst Prof Chitre. Hence to reduce reliance on manpower and increase efficiency in water quality monitoring, we are constantly looking into developing new technology with improved capabilities.  Scientifically, the NUSwan test drives a new paradigm of freshwater monitoring, one that is persistent and interactive, and is potentially able to sample the dynamics of water quality over space and time at improved resolution at an affordable cost, he added.  The swans work by trawling particular areas of interest in a water body and wirelessly sending back data through cloud computing. Programmers will be able to remotely control the robots, but the aim is to ensure they are as autonomous as possible, requiring just basic monitoring and operation, which can happen from anywhere with an internet connection.  The researchers said the swans navigation is more advanced than an automatic vacuum cleaner for instance, which can avoid obstacles but cannot tell where it has already travelled. The SWAN uses GPS to ensure it does not duplicate its monitoring efforts, unless programmed to.  They are durable enough such that even if a recreational water user such as a kayaker, or even a small boat, hits the swan, it will not be damaged, according to the teams behind the technology.  They believe they are at just the tip of realising the potential of this system and have designed the NUSwan to be adaptable to various environmental challenges that may arise.  The NUSwan platform is designed to be extendable  new sensors and actuators can be added on demand to increase its sensing capability, said Mr Koay Teong Beng, one of the other leading researchers on the project.  Already the team is collaborating with other university researchers to combine technologies and stretch the swans to their technological limits.  This includes a highly sensitive freshwater phosphate sensor, which is being developed independently by a separate NUS team. Phosphates are key nutrients in the development of blue-green algal blooms, which can be devastating for water sources.  There is a hope that technology such as the phosphate sensor could be mobilised by the NUSwan, and provide a real-world alarm system to the threat of algal blooms, a common problem encountered in more polluted waterways as a result of fertilisers, sewerage and domestic waste.  Earlier this year, a proliferation of algal blooms in oxygen-depleted, bacteria-rich waters caused thousands of fish to die. While the phosphate sensor has only been tested in fresh water, it is this kind of scenario that it is designed to help prevent.  Phosphate detection was lacking; phosphate sensors are not available in the market, said Lanry Yung, Associate Professor of Chemical and Bio-molecule Engineering . The prototype is finished. Now we are trying to do automation and collaboration with the NUSwan team to work on hardware.  Salt complicates the process, but nonetheless its something to look into at the next stage, he said.  The NUSwan has received interest from water authorities across the region, particularly in China where water pollution is a pressing issue and where the system will be tested on several rivers in the south of the country. That could potentially see the robotic swans floating on some of the worlds largest water reservoirs in the near future.  We see the potential of having NUSwans deployed in urban freshwater bodies and coastal water beyond Singapore. With the data stored in the cloud, collaborators may share and aggregate data and understand global phenomena, Asst Prof Chitre said.",2015-07-03,"EXCLUSIVE: Singapore researchers are testing robotic swans that could provide essential, highly advanced water testing in reservoirs around ...",Robot swans bring new advanced technology to water testing,http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/robot-swans-bring-new/1958380.html
92,"Every six months, the pieces of silicon glue used on a fan cover of an aircraft engine need to be replaced.  A worker takes eight to 12 hours to complete the tedious task. But a robot does it in four hours.  Such industrial robots are increasingly being used on the factory floor, prompting the introduction of a new training programme.  Announced yesterday, its aim is to train more than 2,000 professionals, managers, executives and technicians in the next two years to operate and implement automated production systems.  The training will be done by the Robotics Application Centre of Excellence (Race), a collaboration between professors from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and local precision engineering company PBA Group.  Said Race chief executive Derrick Yap: ""South-east Asia has been earmarked to be the factory of the world and Singapore, being at the epicentre of the region, is very well-positioned (to take advantage of this).""  The series of courses under the new Robotics Applications Training and Education Programme starts on Jan 11, with a one-day ""novice"" level session for people without any technical background in robotics and automation. They will learn about technology trends and how to analyse the cost-effectiveness of adopting robotics and automation. The session costs $50 for Singaporeans, after subsidies.  The next two higher-level courses, each to run for five days, will be launched in March, with another two to follow later.  Mr Gilbert Tan, chief executive of the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), urged firms and industries to prepare for the future and adopt more advanced technology in manufacturing. His institute has signed an agreement with Race and Workforce Singapore to develop skills training and support employers in staff development.  Race will also team up with the Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association and e2i, to help its members learn about technology and buy more of it.  Yesterday, Race held a session on it for about 40 company officials.  ASTech managing director Mun Kok Woh, whose robotics solutions company employs 12 people, said it is costly for his more experienced staff to stop work to train new hires.

93,"With Singapore's rapidly-ageing population, there will be more seniors needing care in future, but not enough carers to do the job.  This is why hospitals are turning to robots and other assistive technology to ease the burden on the manpower-strapped sector.  Instead of a nurse checking every 15 minutes for six hours, to see if a patient who has had a cathether inserted is bleeding, a special blood-sensitive ""bandage"" can do the job, freeing the nurse for six hours of more fulfilling work.  A robot, not a therapist, can help recovering stroke patients exercise; another can keep early stage dementia patients occupied and alert them to take their medicine, or to call for a helper when it senses that they are struggling to get up.  Call it Changi General Hospital's answer to the labour crunch. This technology can become mainstream within the next few years.     President Tony Tan looks at a Interactive Robot for Telemedicine during the opening of the new Integrated Building at Changi General Hospital on 23 July, 2015.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG     Dr Chionh Chang Yin, who heads Renal Medicine at CGH, plans to trial the blood-sensitive bandages designed by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) later this year.  If it works as well as expected, it can be used not only for dialysis patients, but also heart patients who have had a stent put in, or had to do an angiogram to check the heart.  Bleeding from the puncture hole is rare, said Dr Chionh, but should it happen, a patient can bleed to death if not treated imediately. The SUTD device can tell blood from other fluids, and will set off an alarm if it senses one millilitre of blood.     Health Minister Gan Kim Yong looks at a HOSPI Autonomous Delivery Robot during the opening of the new Integrated Building at Changi General Hospital on 23 July, 2015.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG     The idea for the Centre for Healthcare Assitive and Robotics Technology (Chart), started early last year and launched by President Tony Tan on Thursday (July 23), was triggered by the visit of a team from Japan in 2012 wanting to know if there was a market for such products.  Dr Lee Chien Earn, CGH's Chief Executive Officer, said some technology might be great, but not what patients or hospitals want. So CGH decided to work with industry on what it needs instead.  ""It's better to create solutions to meet needs,"" he said. ""The user must be involved from the start.""  The technology does not have to be new, he said. It can be something used in other industries that can be adapted to healthcare needs.  Examples that are now being tweaked to fit healthcare settings include automated guided vehicles (AGV) used in warehouses. The unit can carry shelves holding food, linen or files, or move heavy items like beds. All it needs is a map of the hospital to find its way around.  The idea is to ""take the manual out of healthcare"", said Chart's director Ms Selina Seah, adding that it is increasingly hard to find people to fill jobs like porters.  A team from the Nanyang Technological University took six months to convert an industrial robotic arm to pick and pack a range of objects, including fragile items.  Ms Seah said the robot arm can work non-stop and do the job without mistakes, unlike people who get tired and could become careless.  Dr Tan said Chart provides a platform for research institutes, companies and healthcare practitioners to collaborate in the development of new, impactful healthcare delivery solutions.  He revealed that Chart will be part of the National Robotics Programme. The Government will release details later this year of this multi-agency initiative to test-bed robotic technologies across various sectors, he said.

94,"When she got married 10 years ago, Ms Pranoti Nagarkar Israni, co-founder of automatic roti- maker Rotimatic, would painstakingly make chapati, an Indian flat bread, for her husband.  The time-consuming and tedious task of kneading the dough and slaving behind the stove every day got her thinking of developing an automatic roti-maker.  As it turned out, she and her husband Rishi Israni, both 34 and graduates from the National University of Singapore, were perfectly suited to the task.  Ms Nagarkar is a mechanical engineer, while Mr Rishi is a computer science graduate who ran his own mobile security company. So, she took charge of figuring out the mechanics of the roti-maker, while he figured out the software technology.  The India-born Singapore citizens, who have a three-year-old son, started Zimplistic in 2008. Eight years later, the company's first and only product, the Rotimatic, has finally been shipped to its first batch of customers. They had placed orders in 2014.  The robotic roti-maker received special mention in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech last Sunday.  1. Plug in the Rotimatic and switch it on. It takes three to four minutes to heat up. Meanwhile, fill the compartments with flour, oil and water. 2. On the touchscreen, select the number of roti required, the thickness, roast level and amount of oil (one or two drops for each roti). Press the start button. 3. The machine will start to churn out a ball of dough from the flour, oil and water. If the dough is not formed properly, an error message will appear and the dough can be removed by opening the side door to the machine. The dough-making will then resume. 4. Once the dough is formed, a lever pushes it onto a hot pan to cook. The dough is flattened into a disc and it puffs up while cooking . When the first roti is being cooked, the machine will start kneading the dough for the next one. 5. Once cooked, the roti is pushed out onto the attached (removable) tray. It is best eaten hot with curry, as a wrap with filling or as a dessert crepe. 6. The machine can make up to 20 roti in less than 30 minutes. If there is not enough flour, water or oil in the containers, the machine will prompt the user to add more ingredients. 7. To clean the Rotimatic, the ingredient containers and parts used for the kneading of the dough can be removed for washing. When cool, the hot pan (not removable) can be wiped clean.  Watch how the Rotimatic works at str.sg/4cGh  When speaking on promoting entrepreneurship, he cited it as one of the success stories from start-up hot spot Block 71 in Ayer Rajah Crescent. It is run by the JTC Corporation and is part of the JTC LaunchPad programme, which provides a nurturing environment for start-ups.  Zimplistic's office is now located in Commonwealth Lane.  The machine can make up to 20 cooked roti in under 30 minutes, using only whole wheat flour, oil and water.  Users select the thickness of the roti, roast level, amount of oil and number of roti required, and press a button to start the process.  Each Rotimatic is priced at US$999 (S$1,351). It is made in Malaysia, weighs 18kg and is about the size of a microwave oven.  Pre-orders for the next batch of machines are likely to open next month, says Ms Nagarkar, but deliveries may be made only in the first quarter of next year, as the company is now shipping machines to customers in the United States who pre-ordered them.  Shipment has been completed for the ""few hundred"" Singapore orders.  Within five days of launching pre-orders in the US and Singapore in June 2014, the company received more than 8,000 orders.  Ms Nagarkar says customers were updated via e-mail about the progress and were allowed to request refunds at any time. Seven per cent of customers who preordered asked for refunds, she adds.  On the challenges faced at the beginning, she says: ""Many people thought the Rotimatic was a crazy idea. Building a team and getting investors were tough. We needed to raise money and credibility.""  To build buzz, she took part in the Start-Up @Singapore Business Plan Competition in 2009 and won the top prize of $40,000 for the Rotimatic.  The following year, the company got its first seed funding of US$400,000 from angel investors. In 2012, Zimplistic received US$3 million from private investors and, in July last year, another US$11.5 million of funding was received from venture capital firm NSI Ventures and global engineering giant Robert Bosch GMbH.  Calling the eight years it took to perfect the Rotimatic a ""humbling experience"", she says: ""We took time to stabilise the system, to make sure every roti is consistent. For the past two years, we would make 2,000 roti daily in the office, to test the reliability of the machine.""  Of course, the Rotimatic is not perfect. Currently, it can work with only one brand of flour - Aashirvaad whole wheat flour - which can be bought online at www.myonlinegroceries.com. It costs $2 for a 1kg bag.  If the ball of dough rolled out is not ""perfect"", the machine will alert users to discard the dough before churning out another batch.  Ms Nagarkar says: ""For the first batch of machines that we have sent out, perhaps the first five roti may not be great. It is also a learning path for the machine.""  There are plans to upgrade the software so users can make other types of flat breads and add ingredients such as herbs and spices to the dough.  The smart flat bread-maker is programmed to enable software upgrades over the cloud and remote troubleshooting via an app.  This will also allow users to get recipes from Zimplistic's in-house chef, who was initially hired to provide meals for the 85 office staff. The chef now helps in product development.  Ms Nagarkar hopes to sell the Rotimatic to other countries such as India, as well as in the Middle East and Britain.  The product will be sold exclusively online - she has no plans to sell it in supermarkets or department stores. However, she does not rule out doing product demonstrations for consumers to understand how the machine works.  On the hefty price tag, she says the Rotimatic - with its smart functions and cooking abilities - is unlike other kitchen appliances.  She says: ""The making of roti - it's the same amount of hassle and pain required when washing clothes with your hands. When you have a washing machine, you realise how much time it saves you.  ""Rotimatic is similar, in terms of saving you time and tedious labour. And you get a cooked product at the end of it.""

99,"The robot, PictoBot, can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.  SINGAPORE: A spray-painting robot could halve the number of workers needed to paint walls at industrial developments, do the job 25 per cent faster and improve safety, announced Nanyang Technological University (NTU), JTC and the National Research Foundation (NRF) on Wednesday (Oct 26).  Industrial buildings come with high ceilings to accommodate bulky equipment and materials. Currently, the conventional method for spray painting requires a team of two painters using a scissor lift to reach the high ceilings.  ""Working at such heights exposes painters to various safety risks,"" they said.  In comparison, the 1.5-tonne PictoBot needs only one human supervisor on ground level. Using its optical camera and laser scanner, the robot can navigate and paint walls up to 10 metres high with its robotic arm.  PictoBot can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.     It can also work four hours on one battery charge, giving walls an even coat of paint that matches industry standards. It can even operate in the dark, the organisations added.  These features allow the robot to paint continuously day or night, improving efficiency and freeing up manpower.  Developed in a year at NTU's Robotic Research Centre, the project is supported under NRF's Test-Bedding and Demonstration of Innovative Research funding initiative which aims to use Government-led demand efforts to demonstrate feasibility of innovative technologies and catalyse adoption by private sectors.  To ensure that PictoBot meets industry standards, its developers said it will be tested at industrial developments such as JTC Space @ Gul.  JTC Director of Innovation Programme Office and Corporate Planning Anil Das said that such robotic solutions help improve the productivity of the construction industry.
