1,"In the face of a decline in manpower, the role of technology in defence is more important than ever, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen yesterday.  He was speaking at the launch of DSO Complex, the new headquarters of defence research organisation DSO National Laboratories.  With a total floor area of 69,000 sq m across two eight-storey buildings, the complex in Science Park Drive houses more than 1,000 staff working across 200 laboratories and offices, said DSO. It declined to comment on the cost of the building.  Dr Ng quoted former deputy prime minister Goh Keng Swee, who noted in 1970 that manpower constraints meant that the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) was dependent on technology.  ""If technology was important then when we had fertility rates above replacement level, how much more so now and in our future, when our manpower supply falls"" said Dr Ng.  Dr Goh had established the predecessor of DSO in 1972 when he was defence minister.  DSO Complex will play a key role in driving ""experimental laboratories"" to provide the SAF with ""indigenous and special capabilities"" to meet a wide spectrum of security challenges, said Dr Ng.  These include facilities dedicated to two key areas: artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.  The Playground - a dedicated space where DSO staff across various disciplines can explore and test ideas - features an artificial intelligence hub, which works on projects such as the use of video analytics to identify and track suspicious targets based on attributes such as height and clothing, and even one's gait.  It is also working on a platform that can profile suspected terrorists across multiple social media platforms.  DSO is currently engaging various government agencies on the implementation of the technology, said information division laboratory head Teow Loo Nin.  Meanwhile, a 500 sq m robotics laboratory allows engineers to develop and test robotic systems, prior to field trials. These include a variety of unmanned vehicle systems that can operate across land, sea and air.  Unmanned ground vehicles, developed by DSO, are able to navi- gate their way through forested areas without the benefit of GPS, said robotics autonomy programme manager Hikaru Fuji- shima. ""We had to develop complex, in-house algorithms to process the sensor data that allows the vehicles to operate in off-road environments,"" he said.  These ground vehicles can be paired with unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance and intelligence-gathering purposes.  In order to meet the changing needs of both the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) and the SAF, DSO needs to harness expertise across various science and engineering disciplines, said DSO chief executive Cheong Chee Hoo.  The new complex is designed to facilitate collaboration not only be- tween DSO scientists and engineers, but also with its partners in Mindef, SAF and other agencies, he added.",2017-04-21,"Dr Ng quoted former deputy prime minister Goh Keng Swee, who noted in 1970 that manpower constraints meant that the Singapore Armed ...",Room to work on robotics and AI in new DSO Complex,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/room-to-work-on-robotics-and-ai-in-new-dso-complex,0

The first hospital in Woodlands, which broke ground on Tuesday (Apr 18), is exploring the use of technology to improve the patient care experience.  SINGAPORE: The Woodlands Health Campus (WHC), the first hospital in Woodlands, is expected to use the widespread adoption of technology to improve the patient care experience.     The 1,800-bed facility, which broke ground on Tuesday (Apr 18), will open progressively from 2022.    Located along Woodlands Drive 17, it will be about the size of 11 football fields and serve more than 935,000 residents. It will feature an integrated acute and community hospital, specialist outpatient clinics and a long-term care facility.  Speaking at the groundbreaking event, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said the use of smart technology to raise the bar for patient care and the development of new care models towards greater community-based care were two areas he hoped to see the healthcare complex pioneer.    Mr Gan said that while the co-location of acute and community care services was not new, WHC was the first to have these facilities conceptualised and built at the same time and this would enable it to better integrate care.    ""It will enable patients to be treated and rehabilitated effectively in the appropriate setting so that they can return home to their loved ones as soon as possible, the Health Minister added.    WHC will also have green spaces for recreational or rehabilitation activities designed in consultation with NParks and a garden for dementia patients at the long-term care facility.  At the new hospital, clinicians will make use of artificial intelligence to make sense of large amounts of data quickly. This will allow them to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide cheaper, better and faster care, the hospital said.     Electronic wristbands similar to smart watches will also be used by nurses to monitor patients' conditions in the hospital and after they return home.  While the actual form of the smart device is still in development, some features the hospital said it aimed to provide patients with include the ability to track their schedule such as rehabilitation therapy sessions and medication times, and built-in sensors to conduct real-time monitoring of patients' heartbeat and sleep patterns.  Robotics will automate back-end logistics such as food services, housekeeping and the central sterile supplies unit to free up more time for staff to attend to the personal needs of patients, the hospital said.    Services such as check-in and registration, filling of medical information, ordering medication and payment will be brought online so patients can complete such procedures in their own homes.",2017-04-17,"SINGAPORE: The Woodlands Health Campus (WHC), the first hospital in Woodlands, is expected to use the widespread adoption of ...","Artificial intelligence, robotics to be part of patient care at new ...",http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/artificial-intelligence-robotics-to-be-part-of-patient-care-at/3685722.html,0
4,"It's no RoboCop, but this autonomous patrol bot is going to be seen more and more often around Singapore.  Ademco, a local security services company, recently launched a rent-a-robot service, in response to fewer people signing up to work as security guards.  The 1.6m-tall robots are less like China's egg-shaped robot police, but more like a submarine, with five cameras on its long neck, two front cameras, and four wheels.  The robot can also record licence plates, as well as a 360-degree view of surrounding activities from up to 10 meters (32 feet) away.  It'll also send alerts to a 24-hour manned command center if it detects abnormalities like fire or loud sounds.  These robots are made by San Francisco-based SMP Robotics. The bots are designed to withstand Singapore's tropical climate, high heat, and humidity levels.  Ademco is hoping the robots will help offer an additional resource to its roster of human guards.  Companies can spend up to S$8,000 ($5,704) per month for two security guards covering 12-hour shifts, while the robot  which can operate nearly all day (minus charging times) would cost about S$500 ($356) less, estimates TODAY.  And unlike humans, these robots do not tire.  ""There are also limitations in human beings,"" Ademco group managing director, Toby Koh, told Channel NewsAsia.  Security staff patrol seven to eight times every 12 hours, he said. ""If I were to do a patrol 10 times a day, at some point, my ability to focus and concentrate, [to] try to identify abnormalities...is going to deteriorate.""  Perhaps more importantly, robot officers won't suffer from high turnover rates. With the long hours, Singapore is facing a shortage of security guards. In a 2014 report by the Straits Times, it's estimated that the country needed about 10,000 more guards, and security companies had to look to hiring personnel from Taiwan for armed auxiliary security services.  Patrick Lim, Ademco's director of group sales and marketing, said another reason for the high turnover is that security guards tend to get put off by some of the more mundane parts of the job over time.  If that can be replaced by machines, leaving the guards do perform more high-value skills, more people could be persuaded to stay on, he said.  Ademco's main competitor, Certis Cisco, told TODAY that it was also keen to use autonomous bots, but didn't say if it would roll out a similar service.

8,"Automated plane boarding bridges to be developed in Singapore  With rapid advancements made in robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Singapore Technologies Engineering (ST Engineering) is all set to develop automated passenger boarding bridges in five to six years. This feature will be introduced at Changi Airport which will allow passengers to move from the airport terminal gate to an airplane without being exposed to the weather.  Director of ST Engineering-NTU Corporate Lab Paul Tan said, In Singapore, during the heavy weather period you could have thunderstorms that may impede a lot of the sensor operations.  If it (the bridge) is not docked properly it could add on to delays, and in the worst case it may lead to mishaps which might damage the aircraft, he said.  Tan added, By introducing automation, we provide precision control capabilities that allow the bridge to automatically dock to the aircraft regardless of weather conditions, thereby taking away the risk of potential damage or collision with ground vehicles.  The automated passenger boarding bridges use pre-determined markings based on existing aircraft types to align the bridge with the plane  allowing it to perform under adverse weather conditions at both day and night.  He also observed, ST Engineering started looking at a whole suite of airport robotics solutions about two years ago when various authorities approached the company to introduce robotics and AI into the airport environment.  Interestingly, Changi Airport Group (CAG) announced in January, a SGD50 million programme with the Economic Development Board (EDB) to develop solutions in robotics and unmanned systems, among others, in a live airport environment.  Tan added, As part of ST Engineerings effort to help Changi Airport in its airport transformation, we are focusing our robotics and intelligence systems on the airports air side as well as the terminus side. These systems can be used at both existing and new airport terminals.  Other works in the pipeline include an automated baggage tractor for baggage handling, and a smart wheelchair convoy system. Together with the automated passenger boarding bridge, Tan said he believes the airport would be able to enhance their productivity by at least 50 per cent.",2017-04-20,"With rapid advancements made in robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Singapore Technologies Engineering (ST Engineering) is all set to ...",Automated plane boarding bridges to be developed in Singapore,http://www.connectedtoindia.com/automated-plane-boarding-bridges-to-be-developed-in-singapore-1230.html,1
9,"SINGAPORE - Once flooded with endless questions every day, receptionists at rental office firm Crosscoop Singapore may soon have an easier day at the office thanks to a new colleague who is literally wired for the job.  NAO, a humanoid robot, can provide a range of information from the phone numbers of recommended accounting firms to details about nearby restaurants including cuisine type and pricing. The robot, which can communicate in Japanese and English, occasionally breaks into a dance too.  NAO is just 57cm tall and bears a childlike appearance.  To access its database, visitors and tenants at Crosscoop Singapore need to select the type of information they want on a tablet placed in front of it, and the robot will provide the answer.  On Thursday (April 6), the firm gave a demonstration of NAO's abilities to the media.  NAO is on a two-month trial at the firm, a collaboration between SoftBank Telecom Singapore, Crosscoop Singapore and IT firm Nippon Jimuki. The trial ends in May.  NAO was previously on trial at MY World Preschool in Bukit Panjang, where it taught children in interactive ways, such as by dancing.  According to SoftBank Telecom Singapore - the local distributor of NAO - about 60 units of the robot, each costing about $14,000, has been sold here.  Crosscoop Singapore's hope is that NAO will help to reduce the monthly working hours of each receptionist from 160 hours to 150 hours.  The firm operates on the 10th storey of a commercial building at 80, Robinson Road.  Ms Atsuko Sato, 32, an office manager at Crosscoop Singapore, said she and other staff manning the front desk often get questions about Singapore from the 80 Japanese companies it rents office space to, including where to eat and the names of banks here.

15,"McKinsey & Company's new Singapore Digital Capability Centre (DCC), opening on April 11, will help local companies harness emerging technological changes - collectively known as Industry 4.0 - that are disrupting industries around the world, according to Oliver Tonby, McKinsey's South-east Asia managing partner.  MCKINSEY & Company's new Singapore Digital Capability Centre (DCC), opening on April 11, will help local companies harness emerging technological changes - collectively known as Industry 4.0 - that are disrupting industries around the world, according to Oliver Tonby, McKinsey's South-east Asia managing partner.  Mr Tonby said Industry 4.0 describes four broad disruptions. They are: increasing data availability and interconnectivity; analytics and business intelligence (BI) capabilities, including artificial intelligence (AI); advanced human-machine interactions such as cobots (a collaborative robot that interacts with humans in the workplace); and advanced production methods such as 3-D printing.  All these are expected to transform the entire life cycle of a business' product, from customer order to after-sales.  The Singapore centre is part of a global network of five DCCs that McKinsey has around the world. The Singapore centre will be in partnership with A*Star's Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC) and, apart from Singapore, will also serve the South-east Asian region. McKinsey is spending US$15 million upfront in establishing the centre and will employ 10 new full-time employees. According to sources close to the project, McKinsey expects that more investments in the centre will be ongoing as it expands and increases its scope. Most of the money is likely to go into hiring more skilled personnel.  Talking to The Business Times, Mr Tonby noted that with manufacturing accounting for one-fifth of Singapore's economic output, ""the facility is in line with the nation's push to become a regional hub for advanced manufacturing (AM)"".  He added: ""Singapore, in our view, is also uniquely positioned to become the home of smart manufacturing pilots. The DCC is also designed to be especially relevant to regionally important sectors including discrete manufacturing, semiconductors, oil and gas, electric power, and mining.  ""We see DCC Singapore playing an integral role in the ecosystem, drawing on ARTC's state-of-the-art facilities and research and development capabilities across A*Star, ranging from manufacturing, data analytics, virtual process modelling, and digital solutions for complex manufacturing processes.""  David Low, ARTC's CEO, told BT that his organisation would be jointly conducting manpower training sessions with McKinsey for companies to get an appreciation of lean manufacturing and Industry 4.0.  ""These sessions will leverage DCC's learning modules across themes such as predictive maintenance, digitised performance management, procurement and supply chain. The DCC will utilise part of ARTC's Model Factory testbed that will be launched in the later part of the year,"" Mr Low said.  The Model Factory testbed will provide a learning environment for companies to experience advanced manufacturing technologies, so that they can acquire and deepen their knowledge and skills in such technologies, thereby reducing the risks involved in adopting AM in their own factories and processes  ARTC will also groom talent for Future of Manufacturing technologies through workshops and on-the-job training. At any one time, ARTC has at least 30 interns from the various Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) such as NTU (Nanyang Technological University), NUS (National University of Singapore, SUTD (Singapore University of Technology and Design), Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Nanyang Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic.  As new technologies such as robotics, digitalisation, IoT (Internet of Things) and analytics come online, the manufacturing sector is changing dramatically. Advanced manufacturing is one of the areas identified by the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) as a growth cluster. CFE noted that Singapore should augment its current base of complex manufacturing capabilities, and prepare its workforce to take on the jobs created by the integration and adoption of AM technologies.  Recently German semiconductor giant, Infineon Technologies, announced that it is spending 70 million euros (S$104.8 million) in five years till 2021 to develop a smart factory at its backend manufacturing plant in Singapore. Infineon said it would progressively increase the level of automation, connectivity and control within the factory. It added that Industry 4.0 ""is not only the next step in automation, but will substantially change how we work; machines are becoming more intelligent and will be able - to a large extent - to control and optimise themselves and the production process in which they are involved"".  McKinsey's Mr Tonby said the company's DCCs around the world will simulate different companies, depending on the needs of the region. ""For example, the Singapore facility will feature a gearbox manufacturer whereas the German facility will feature a woven smart wristband producer. Ultimately, the realistic production environment is the biggest differentiator as all centres will feature similar capability learning modules which will be developed in synergy and then tailored to the simulated business.""  He added that the Singapore centre will showcase applications beyond the four pillars of Industry 4.0 - data analytics, robotics, 3-D printing and connectivity - to ""include technologies that can be adopted across the entire value chain encompassing product development, procurement and supply chain"".  The Singapore facility will offer companies at different stages of their Industry 4.0 transformations with the following help:  Among the many technology showcases on offer at the DCC, one will be on predictive maintenance. ""New technology today uses real time data to predict and prevent breakdowns and can reduce down time by 50 per cent. At the DCC, participants will learn about these new technologies and also pilot them on site, before applying them to their own setting. We think this approach can be transformational in the adoption of Industry 4.0,"" Mr Tonby said.  ARTC's Mr Low noted that Industry 4.0 is still a relatively new concept and not all companies are convinced of the value that these technologies can bring them.  Companies need to understand how they will be left behind if they do not adopt Industry 4.0, as the future of manufacturing will see a move towards the replacement of labour-intensive processes with disruptive technologies such as digital manufacturing, robotics and automation, he said, adding: ""To remain relevant, companies must identify and learn about the types of advanced technologies which can make a significant difference to their businesses, and open up new revenue streams.""  Mr Low added that with strong government support in this space, along with a well integrated ecosystem of relevant government agencies, researchers and the industry, Singapore is in a good position in the adoption of Industry 4.0.

16,"Singapore has a big ambition to become a Smart Nation.  But what is a Smart Nation  On one level, it is about the exploitation of technologies in order to make the lives of people better, by giving them convenient and fast access to information and to customised services, including those that we cannot even imagine today. The current state of technology already offers all the ingredients of a Smart Nation.  But on another - I would argue more fundamental - level, being a Smart Nation calls for innovation at the systems level - aggregating technologies and combining them with new operating concepts, policies and plans - to solve national problems, such as the effects of climate change, traffic congestion, an ageing population, or simply to improve service delivery.  But its realisation is the sum of many innovations, big and small. Its ambition should be big, but its implementation is in hundreds and thousands of projects, both large and little.  But on both levels, it is a product of our imagination, and it is limited only by our imagination. Imagine a Smart Nation where there is increased efficiency, convenience and connectivity in and between workplaces and homes. Wearable technology such as hologram devices are used on the go to check and respond to work e-mails. Wi-Fi is available islandwide, eliminating restrictions from fixed data and limited call minutes. In the workplace, robots take over routine administrative tasks like coordinating meetings, conducting research and running daily errands.  At home, robotic helpers do the household chores and prepare meals. They order groceries when food items are low in stock, which are then delivered by drone to the doorstep.  Throughout Singapore, there are healthcare pods deployed islandwide at every housing block. These provide medical diagnosis, dispense medicine and provide simple medical services as well. These make it more convenient for elderly residents, who have mobility problems, and those who do not have the time to visit a clinic.  However, the Government may not be structured to reach this level of imagination and boldness of vision. Some might argue that it is not even its business. Innovation at this level is perhaps better achieved by the private sector, and by individual start-ups with the boldness and the ideas.     Dr Marcelo Ang, acting director at the National University of Singapore's Advanced Robotics Centre, with the autonomous driverless vehicle Scot, which is being tested at one-north. More test-bedding of Smart Nation technologies in real-life settings should be encouraged and organised, says the speaker. ST FILE PHOTO     Empowerment is key. Too much top-down control will kill the spirit of innovation that is central to a Smart Nation. Instead, the role of the Government should be to facilitate such innovation by funding incentives and arrangements through flexible - rather than restrictive - regulations.  A good example of this approach is the Monetary Authority of Singapore's establishment of a regulatory sandbox last year to allow fintech companies to experiment with products and services in an environment where, if an experiment fails, ""it fails safely and cheaply within controlled boundaries, without widespread adverse consequences"".  The Government also has a key role in connecting these innovations to their societal environments, by encouraging and organising test-bedding and pilots of Smart Nation technologies in real-life settings, and perhaps even by insuring the risk of some of these experiments.  In Singapore, a precinct - one-north - is now the site of a major pilot for the use of autonomous vehicles - or driverless cars - testing not just the technologies for the cars, but also for the road furniture. Such experiments and trials are essential because the development of these technologies and their applications need to be test-bedded in real environments.  If the pilot is successful, then the programme may be expanded beyond this precinct into the larger national transport system, relieving road congestion and getting people to their destinations faster - and more safely - and, like Car-Free Sunday SG, helping to realise the vision of a car-lite Singapore.  But there is a political challenge to such ambition. There are many misconceptions about the technologies associated with a Smart Nation. One big misconception is that in a 24/7 online world constantly surrounded by innumerable sensors and smart objects all connected to the Internet - the Internet of Things - absolute privacy and absolute security can be achieved.  As smart objects seek to gather more contextual information on behaviour and actions, the ability of smart devices to analyse people's lives and discover their identities will challenge traditional notions of privacy. Such information can clearly be misused and abused, compromising privacy and security.  There is another related issue - a fear, perhaps irrational in some countries and rational in others - that the government will exploit these technologies to intrude into the private lives of citizens, or to create an Orwellian system of mass state surveillance.  To overcome these misconceptions, a mature discussion is needed, not a polemical one. The Government has a central role to play in shaping this discussion. It will have to persuade citizens that the benefits outweigh the risks of exploiting these technologies, and then explain how the risks can be managed.  This is clearly in the realm of politics, and the onus must be on the political leadership to convince the people that such fears are misplaced in Singapore. But this can be achieved only if there is trust between the people and the Government. As I observed earlier, trust in a fast-changing and complex world is a vital asset to good governance.  Change cannot be avoided. Innovation must be continuous because the world does not stand still. Change and its handmaiden - innovation - must be embraced as an imperative of governance. Furthermore, there is no end point. It is a journey without a fixed destination, because the future is an ever-shifting horizon.  But people dislike change - it is human nature. Change requires leadership, because it means leading people out of their comfort zone. Getting them to change is an act of will. The future-fit leader has to persuade his people to believe in the need for change, instil confidence in change and empower his people to change.  Successful leaders of change also make their people brave enough to express their opinions, change their behaviour, take risks and learn from failure. They tolerate mavericks - even if they do not embrace them - because all future-fit organisations need mavericks. They are the ones who are prepared to challenge conventional wisdom and come up with the ideas that can change the rules of the game. Some will argue that leaders should be more tolerant of mavericks.  My response to this is: ""Yes, but only up to a point."" A maverick is a maverick only if he is fighting the establishment. If he believes enough in his ideas, he ought to have the courage and conviction of his beliefs to push them, even against resistance. If he gives up the moment he runs into some opposition or official rebuff, then in my book, he is not a maverick. I think this is a sound approach. It is essentially a Darwinian process, in which only those who have thought through their ideas and are prepared to stand up and defend them, deserve the chance of a second hearing. Some mavericks will survive.  In today's world of accelerating change - the Anthropocene - we will need to dare to dream and to experiment with things no one else has done before. We must steel ourselves to embark on journeys of discovery, in which the destinations are unknown, and we must be prepared to cope with unexpected outcomes, to experiment, to manage the risk, to fail and then to pick ourselves up and keep going.",2017-04-20,"Singapore has a big ambition to become a Smart Nation. ... acting director at the National University of Singapore's Advanced Robotics Centre, ...",A Smart Nation limited only by imagination,http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/a-smart-nation-limited-only-by-imagination,-1
17,"Works are in full swing at the future Tuas port, with reclamation ongoing for two out of four phases of the development and more than 3km of caisson already installed to form the wharf.  The caisson, which sits on a foundation on the seabed, is a 28m-high concrete watertight structure - about the height of a 10-storey Housing Board block. Using caissons to build the wharf structure is faster than traditional methods like piling.  In all, 8.6km of caisson will have to be constructed under Phase 1 of the Tuas port project, which aims to grow the Singapore port, amid competition from other regional and global ports.  The new Tuas port - which will be twice the size of Ang Mo Kio town - will be opened progressively from 2021. When fully completed by 2040, it will be able to handle up to 65 million twenty-foot equivalent units of cargo a year, more than double what the port handled last year.  Work on the port, which will eventually house current operations at Pasir Panjang, Tanjong Pagar, Keppel and Brani container terminals, is proceeding as planned despite the current industry downturn.  Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) chief executive Andrew Tan told The Straits Times: ""As a small and open country, any significant changes in the global economy would affect Singapore.""  Still, Singapore has maintained its position as a global port hub and an international maritime centre, despite the current slowdown.  He said: ""PSA's volumes are holding steady, vessel arrival tonnage has increased, more ships are being flagged under our registry and bunker volumes remain high.""  Reflecting the current industry challenges, the Singapore Maritime Week 2017 officially opened yesterday with the theme Navigating Through Challenging Times.  More than 20,000 maritime professionals, including high-level delegates from port authorities, industry leaders and maritime experts, are expected to attend the programmes throughout this week.  As part of the event, members of the public can take a virtual tour of the Port Operations Control Centre which helps to secure Singapore's waters, and also watch a drone that can analyse the chemical composition of hazardous smoke.  At the opening yesterday, Senior Minister of State for Transport Josephine Teo said it is critical for the industry to band together to face challenges. For example, to meet the sector's long-term demand for talent, the Singapore Maritime Foundation is working with government agencies and private companies to offer incentives such as scholarships.  And as part of the move to Tuas, MPA is studying new technologies and automation, including the use of robotics and drones that will not only make port operations more effective and efficient, but also more attractive for those considering joining the industry.",2017-04-23,Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) chief executive Andrew ... including the use of robotics and drones that will not only make port ...,Full steam ahead for new Tuas mega port,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/full-steam-ahead-for-new-tuas-mega-port,1
18,"These are bold goals but work is underway to move towards that vision through advanced manufacturing, the Economic Development Board's (EDB) assistant managing director Lim Kok Kiang told The Business Times in an exclusive interview.  SINGAPORE has a vision: That is all factories housed in the Republic will be the most globally competitive, efficient and productive for companies.  These are bold goals but work is underway to move towards that vision through advanced manufacturing, the Economic Development Board's (EDB) assistant managing director Lim Kok Kiang told The Business Times in an exclusive interview.  For one thing, the manufacturing sector here is at an inflexion point, having reached a critical mass for the fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, to take off.  Advanced manufacturing is a fusion of new automation technologies, such as robotics, additive manufacturing and autonomous guided vehicles, with industrial Internet of Things, like cloud computing, augmented reality and machine learning.  Said Mr Lim: ""If we are successful, hopefully all plants in Singapore, especially the bigger plants, will be the most competitive plant for that company on a global basis.""  There are currently some plants in Singapore which already fit that description. ""Imagine if all plants in Singapore are actually that way,'' said Mr Lim. ""The existing plant can also, through the adoption of all these technologies over a period of time, be the most competitive plant for that company on a global basis."" This will ensure that the manufacturing sector continues to contribute 20 per cent to the country's economy.  The Committee on the Future Economy has identified advanced manufacturing as one of the key growth areas for Singapore. Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 plan, the government has set aside S$3.2 billion for advanced manufacturing and engineering.  Said Mr Lim: ""We already have a big manufacturing base in Singapore, so we are not starting from zero. These companies are constantly looking at ways to improve their manufacturing operations ... because manufacturing is not just about labour cost anymore.""  Singapore is a manufacturing base for a wide number of industries from semiconductors to motors to aircraft engines and even petrochemical plants, all of which are doing relatively well.  Productivity in the manufacturing sector is quite high compared to productivity in Singapore as an average, as the companies are competing on a global basis, Mr Lim noted.  ""A company can choose to put their factory here or in China, Germany or Japan,'' said Mr Lim. Embracing technologies will make Singapore plants more productive, efficient and competitive. Doing that also works in Singapore's favour, as it helps mitigate issues related to labour and land constraints.  ""If we want to continue to expand and be competitive in manufacturing, we must be able to do more with less because we are not able to compete on labour cost alone. And all these technologies are exactly enabling that,"" said Mr Lim.  A fusion of technologies and digitalisation enables factories to become smarter. Sensors are deployed in an industrial setting to allow the process to become more intelligent and interactive. Everything, from maintenance to quality control to monitoring energy efficiency, can be done in a more efficient way.  In predictive maintenance, for instance, sensors can detect when supplies are running low and automatically send out an order for them to be replenished, or they can detect and alert when certain parts need attention. In quality control, image sensors can pick up flaws better than the human eye, thus ensuring quality.  However, there is no one-size-fits-all, stressed Mr Lim, as each company adopts technology in a different way. He also emphasised that it is a continuous journey of improvements and enhancements, where new technologies are integrated over time to improve productivity.  Using technology also adds smartness in automation and opens up new possibilities, such as producing more variety with the same floor space, and new business models, such as customised products.  A certain degree of smartness is needed to attain a lot size of one, or customisation, which is where advanced manufacturing is moving towards.  A case in point is local small and medium enterprise, PBA Group, which has a smart factory that could manufacture its products with a lower production cost per unit than its factory in China.  Meiban Group has plans to invest about S$10 million to S$12 million to testbed solutions in robotics, automation and smart factory software, to achieve a 20 to 30 per cent rise in productivity, and subsequently scale them to its regional factories.  Mr Lim said: ""There could be a potential export of technology and solutions, but the Singapore plant is not staying still. It is continuously making another level of improvement."" In the past, technologies were successful elsewhere before they were replicated here.  He added: ""Instead of us just being fastest implementor of technology, it could be that we are also working and evolving some of these technologies ourselves and exporting them to the other plants of these companies in the region and beyond from Singapore.""  At the launch of Manufacturing Technology Asia 2017 held from April 4 to 7 at Singapore Expo, 25 companies - both manufacturing companies and technology providers - which have made strategic advanced manufacturing investments in Singapore were celebrated and recognised.  Among them was Shell Singapore, which uses drones for site inspections, data analytics and mechanisation to support its maintenance activities. Chevron Oronite's use of a wireless plant network with mobile tracking devices for employees is expected to save 30,000 man-hours each year.  As advanced manufacturing gathers pace, new jobs like data scientists are created, while low-skilled, manual intensive jobs will give way.  Said Mr Lim: ""It is about technology working with people, not technology replacing people. It needs both the workers and the engineers to bring out the best of whatever technology there is.''  Two model factories under public-private partnership with A*Star will also be set up to help SMEs with technology adoption. One will be at the Singapore Institute for Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech) while another will be at the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC).",2017-04-16,"Said Mr Lim: If we are successful, hopefully all plants in Singapore, ... to testbed solutions in robotics, automation and smart factory software, ...",Singapore aims to house the most globally competitive plants,http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/singapore-budget-2017/singapore-aims-to-house-the-most-globally-competitive,0
19,"Research in the manufacturing industry was a bright spot last year, with more than half of the projects undertaken by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*Star) related to the sector.  The agency said these opportunities for local companies to grow through research and development (R&D) have helped to boost Singapore's global competitiveness as a manufacturing hub.  Last year, A*Star worked with various industries on more than 1,700 projects.  It also licensed more than 200 technologies to companies, of which 60 per cent were in the manufacturing industry.  Over the same period, the agency's industry partners spent more than $220 million on joint R&D projects.  To further help companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), get acquainted with advanced manufacturing processes, A*Star will be setting up two model factories at its Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre and Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology by the end of the year.  In these factories, companies will be able to try out and even improve processes such as robotics and information technology to increase efficiency and productivity.  The agency also has schemes that provide companies with access to A*Star's advanced equipment and expertise, before they invest in expensive equipment.  One such firm is CKE Manufacturing. Mr Kwan Li Feng, its enterprise development manager, said: ""We have had constant exposure to new technologies and trends which allow us to plan ahead and take small steps before adopting the various technologies.""  Mr Sam Chee Wah, general manager of SME Feinmetall Singapore, said: ""The agency has helped me to think out of the box and tap technologies that I never knew I needed or wanted.""  More companies can look forward to enrolling in public-private partnerships in the coming years.  For example, A*Star's Operation and Technology Roadmapping programme, which has helped 240 SMEs plan their business strategies in manpower and technology, aims to help 400 more companies over the next four years.  Mr Steven Koh, executive director of the Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association, said the constant threat of disruptive technology means that SMEs must transform and embrace technological innovation to be competitive.  A*Star chairman Lim Chuan Poh said: ""We should always ask ourselves: Are there new sectors that we can move into, are there new areas that we can generate activities  ""It may not be in the next one year, it could be the next three years, it could even be in the next 10 years. And this is where, as a research and innovation organisation, we always have to be a step ahead.""

21,"Worlds collided like slabs of metal in a robotics rink as Immokalee High School competed alongside teams from Kazakhstan to New Zealand under one roof at the 10th annual VEX Robotics World Championship.  The Kentucky Exposition Center, where matches ended Saturdayin Louisville, transformed into an Olympic Village as 1,400 teams from 30 countries and 50 states decorated their booths with cultural memorabilia.  One team from Chengdu, China, lined their table with emerald bamboo shoots, while the booth directly facing them, a team from Muskogee, Oklahoma, went with a hunting theme, covering their walls in a forest green camouflage print and rubber mallard ducks.  Afew rows over, sandwiched between teams from Urumqi, China, and Carrolton, Georgia, two teams from Immokalee hovered over their metal creations, prodding them with Allen wrenches and air compressors.  The robots under operation, named Dragonzord and Megazord, were the brainchildren of a group of seven Immokalee students and their coachFred Rimmler.  Being from Immokalee, you dont really get to meet that many different people, said Dragonzord captain Kristian Trevino, 18. To meet everybody from around the world, its amazing. I think its great.  Kristian and his teammates spent countless hours after school and on weekends since September assembling and reassembling their robots out of nut and bolts, motors, rubber bands and electrical wiring.  The teams qualified for the state championship in Tampa for the first time and arrived at the world competition as underdogs. Immokalees robotics program is only in its second year, and this was the first year the team competed outside the Collier school district.  We never thought wed make it this far in the first place, said Dragonzord mechanic Isaiah Reyna, 16.  On a 12-foot-square playing field, the bots competed to see how many toy stars and cubes each could throw over to the other side in the allotted two minutes. The robots, driven by a designated team member through a game controller, can gain bonus points for climbing onto a corner post and for driving autonomously.  Team Dragonzord enjoyed a solid run, ending with a ranking of 16 out of 94 in their division after winning seven of their 10 qualifying matches. But the results were just low enough to deter the highest-ranking teams from selecting them as allies for the division finals.  Nobody knew where Immokalee was before, but now that weve started getting our name out there, were considered as one of the best teams in Florida, Isaiah said.  Megazord didnt farequite as well, winning just three of their 10 matches because of an unexplainable chronic malfunction. But the team stayed positive and were grateful for the opportunity to represent their small rural town.  Theres a lot of rumors that Immokalees a bad place. This shows that we actually do stuff here, that maybe were not just about agriculture and minorities, said Megazord mechanic George Herrera-Carrillo, 15.  Though they wont be bringing home any hardware, the teams appreciated the opportunity to work with roboticists from other countries including Canada and Singapore.  Isaiah and George enjoyed the unique experience of representing the United States in the Parade of Nations at the opening ceremonies Wednesday.  Everyone was chanting U.S.A.! U.S.A.! he said. There was a lot of excitement and adrenaline going through us.  Several team members used the occasion to explore their interest in Japanese culture and visited the countrys booth several times. The Japanese team offered them gifts including origami cranes and temporary tattoos with Japanese characters, and the teams added each other on Snapchat and Instagram (a sure sign of the beginning of a teenage friendship in 2017).  Theyre so sweet, said Dragonzord mechanic Jennifer Villa, 18. Its nice to have that camaraderie.  Jennifer was one of two girls on Immokalees teams and took part in the competitions first Girl Powered social, an event aimed at recognizing the intrepid women taking part in a male-dominated field.  We dont need an event to tell us we know how to do (robotics), we already know that, Jennifer said. I think it was more for the boys, to show that we deserve the same respect that guys get.  The students werent the only ones who enjoyed the experience. Kristians parents and three siblings drove 16 hours from Immokalee to join the festivities. His mother, Griselda Trevino, took time away from her job in a tomato packing house to watch her son compete.  The tears began to flow after she watched him annihilate his opponents in the final qualifying match.  Im really proud of my son, she said. Im so happy for him.  Kristians father, William Trevino, a surveillance specialist at the Seminole Casino, said though the family doesnt have a lot of resources, watching his son compete on a global level was too important to miss.  Its a once in a lifetime opportunity, he said. Especially for them to go from nothing to something all of a sudden, wow.  Coach Rimmler said he, too, couldnt be more proud of the teams performance.  They far exceeded my expectations in every step of the way this year, he said.",2017-04-22,"The Immokalee High School robotics team participated in the World ... 17, of the Anglo-Chinese School in Singapore during the Vex Robotics ...",Immokalee High team takes on the world in robotics event in Louisville,http://www.naplesnews.com/story/news/education/2017/04/22/immokalee-high-robotics-teams-vs-world/100787554/,-1
22,"The city-state will also host an inaugural Defence Technology Summit in 2018 as it looks to become a global player in modern military advancements.  SINGAPORE: A starting seed grant of S$45 million a year will be given to two new laboratories in the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and DSO National Laboratories organisations, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in Parliament on Friday (Mar 3).    Modern militaries are powered by technology, and the next-generation SAF (Singapore Armed Forces), even more so, he said. Our defence technology organisations will gear up to support changes.    To foster more experimentation and innovation, DSO will set up a robotics lab in April this year and DSTA will expand to include an analytics and artificial intelligence lab.    At the former, defence engineers will collaborate on prototyping, integration, simulation and testing of systems prior to field trials for the SAF. The work on robotics has already begun, said Dr Ng. Six Singapore Infantry Regiment soldiers are currently experimenting with unmanned aerial and ground vehicles to perform missions. The Navy has gone further and is putting Unmanned Surface Vehicles which can navigate and avoid collisions autonomously into operations.    The SAF, working with the Ministry of Home Affairs, has already developed countermeasures to potential drone attacks. These systems were deployed in the last NDP (National Day Parade).    DSTAs new lab will exploit the real-time information that can be derived from the Internet of Things and platforms, said the minister.    The realisable potential is enormous. For instance, our Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre monitors more than 1,500 commercial shipping vessels in our waters daily. It uses AI to generate unique signatures for each, through collating information from multiple sources, including social media. It then detects any deviations from this signature, he explained.    This AI-embedded method detected a possible ISIS supporter on board a tanker in 2015. That person was barred from disembarking in Singapore. Finding this needle in a big haystack is only possible through modern means.    Singapore will also host an inaugural Defence Technology Summit in early 2018. Targeted as a biennial event, the summit will be organised by DSTA together with Singapores universities, A*STAR and Government agencies like GovTech, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, National Research Foundation and Singapore Economic Development Board.    Singapore can lead in defence technology, even though we are small, said Dr Ng. The Summit will provide a global platform to invite leading figures and luminaries to come share their views, provide a window into the future, allow us the opportunity to network and increase our access to new ideas and innovation.    In his speech, Dr Ng also revealed that Singapore has around 5,000 defence engineers and scientists, with the number of related scholarships and awards on offer due to be increased by 40 per cent - up to 170 from 120 today - by 2025.",2017-03-02,"The work on robotics has already begun, said Dr Ng.

23,"Singapore-based VC firm SeedPlus has surpassed its target of S$25 million ($17.9 million) for its debut fund, SeedPlus Fund I  with backing from Cisco Investments, the investment arm of Cisco Systems Inc., and Eight Roads Ventures, the proprietary investment arm of Fidelity International Limited.  SeedPlus is a seed stage venture fundlaunched by Jungle Ventures, a Singapore-based venture capital (VC) firm. Seedplus is backed by SGInnovate, Accel Partners (India) and Ratan Tatas RNT Associates, among others.  IFC, a unit of the World Bank Group, had also recently announced its participation with a $2 million investment.  The SeedPlus investment aligns with IFCs Venture Capital groups strategy to invest in venture capital funds that support innovative technology companies across emerging markets, said Pravan Malhotra, IFCs venture capital lead for Southeast Asia and Asia Internet investments.  Today, there are several fast-evolving, transformative technologies disrupting key industry sectors, enabling entrepreneurship and innovation to flourish in emerging markets, particularly in Southeast Asia, which we see as a growing market for us this year, Malhotra adds.  SeedPlus is run by three operating partners  Michael Smith Jr, who was CTO at streaming service HOOQ, former Spotify product manager Gabriel Lundberg and Tiang Lim Foo, who led Evernotes market development in Asia Pacific.  The firm also announced the joining of Chirayu Wadke as a Partner leading IoT investments. Prior to this Chirayu led strategic business development for a number of product areas at Google in Mountain View.  In an interview with DEALSTREETASIA, Foo explained: Given the experience and network of the team, we tend to look at ourselves asoperating partners to the start-up teams we work with. Theres definitely a huge element of bringing our past operatingexperiences from companies likeSpotify, Google, Yahoo andEvernote where I was from, to partner withproduct and deep tech-drivenfounders and startups.  Given the limited partners (LPs) backing the fund,Foo also notes the potential for co-investments. He said, I think this continues the trend of working with world class limited partners that bring not just capital but amazing expertise, a global network and a unique viewpoint on the global marketplace. Its exciting to engage Cisco across many divisions in Singapore to help our portfolio companies get exposure to Cisco in very unique ways.  With Fidelity, their Eights Roads division is very instrumental in funding and helping growth stage companies around the world and with this partnership we can bring their expertise to seed stage companies in Southeast Asia. The same spirit of partnership extends across our other LPs, as well, he adds.  SeedPlus is also supported by Google and PwC Singapore, given its focus on investing in and helping build startup ventures operating across software-as-a-service (SaaS), financial technology, artificial intelligence (AI), cyber security and other emerging technology areas.  SeedPlus invests up to S$1 million in each startup in Asia andis focused on investing in companies that target large addressable markets in Asia or globally.  Some recent examples include Moglix, an Indian B2B e-commerce platform specialising in maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) industry; Mimetic.ai, a Singaporean technology startup responsible for creating Evie, an artificial intelligence (AI) scheduling assistant; and Homage, a Singapore-based startup that connects in-home caregivers with elderly people seeking assistance.  Overall, how are deal flows in ASEAN looking like Most VCs say the region is not producing requisite deal flows for deployment  do you agree  Deal flowremains healthy in our perspective. One encouraging development is the advent of deeper tech focus accelerators such as the recent Entrepreneurs First program, whom we work closely with. Im excited to see more deep tech focus startups to appear in the near future.  For the companies that you have invested in & will invest in  since you are part of Jungle Ventures  does that mean that they can get follow-on investments  Series A & B from Jungle  There is no exclusivity on follow on capital from our partners when a company receives funding from us. Where companies raise from is up to them, but we hope to show them the value of our network and in the case of our first company we funded, Moglix, they successfully raised Series A from our partners.  Any views on the current exit architecture of the ASEAN region  Exits, either via trade sales (M&A) or IPOs (initial public offers), tend to increase as markets mature, but are also a function of how healthy the ecosystem is at all levels.  Exits are a key ingredient to building a healthy and robust ecosystem and the more success stories SEA can generate, the higher the awareness of the region and, hopefully, more active participation by the larger global acquirers, such as Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, or local startups which are larger such as Grab, PropertyGuru etc. I remain optimistic in the evolution of the ecosystem, as weve seen a steady pace of exits and I do anticipate the volume to pick up as the ecosystem in Southeast Asia matures.  How do you see the launch of startup stock exchanges impacting exit activity in the region  Fundamentally I believe that meaningful exits will happen when and only when start-ups focus on creating valuable businesses. As some might say, companies are bought, not sold  which means to say that startups should focus on building and creating value rather than focusing too much on exits.  Overall, many VC portfolios seem heavily weighted towards IT-related ventures in ASEAN. Do you see any shift towards manufacturing, hardware and robotics asmanufacturing shifts out of China, or will most ASEAN VCs continue to focus on the software sweet spot  Thatsexactly what SeedPlus aims to do. Our investment areas are prettybroad-scope in that sense, spanning acrosssoftware-as-a-service (SaaS), financial technology, artificial intelligence, cyber security and other emerging technology areas, including IOT and connected devices. We do think that theres unique opportunities we can tap by addressinginnovation gaps in manufacturing, hardware androbotics.  What do you make of the view thatVC funds are increasingly adopting a hedge fund-like approach, rather than investing in disruption and innovation  There are different VCs who invest at different stages, serving different needs for the various lifecycle of a startup. Specifically in Southeast Asia, where the ecosystem is still comparativelyyoung, VCs are earlier stages compared to our counterparts on Silicon Valley and the likes.  Ultimately this is ecosystembuilding at itsearliest stages still  and itsfair to say that the healthier theecosystem is, more dollars will circulate back into the ecosystem to fundinnovation.  Moving forward, can Singapore truly become the Silicon Valley for Asia  what are the challenges  is it talent pool, small market, supporting ecosystem  Venture and innovation is tough. To achieve continuous, sustained and long-term value creation, every actor in the ecosystem has a role to play, from founders, early startup talent, funding etc. Again, I remain optimistic that Singapore and the wider Southeast Asia region is moving in the right direction.  Another perspective here is that different venture ecosystems have different natural characteristics. One uniqueness of the Singapore ecosystem is the connectedness with other startup hubs across the region, and even globally. This is a bright spot that I think we should double down on.

SESTO Robotics CEO and co-founder of HOPE Technik, Michael Leong, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that automation ""is a direction that [Singapore] is moving along as the population gets more well-educated.""",2017-04-04,Singaporean autonomous technology firm SESTO Robotics is stepping up its game as it launches the latest model of its Automated Guide ...,Why the rise of autonomous machines could help workers ...,http://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/04/why-the-rise-of-autonomous-machines-could-help-workers-according-to-robotics-ceo.html,0
26,"The march of the robots continues, as Canada's ATB Financial hires dancing humanoids to work in some of its Calgary branches.  ATB becomes the latest bank to test Pepper, the 48-inch humanoid developed by Japanese group Softbank.    Customers at two branches will be able to interact with Pepper through speech and a touchscreen tablet, getting info on products and services.    In addition, the robot will grill customers on their financial literacy through a quiz, take selfies and dance.    Dave Mowat, CEO, ATB, says: ""Pepper is cutting-edge technology. Were excited for her to say hello to our customers and tell them about ATB  or just dance together for a bit.""    Pepper has already made its debut at the flagship Tokyo branch of Mizuho and is also taking orders and payments in some Pizza Hut Asia restaurants thanks to an app built by the MasterCard Labs team in Singapore.    Meanwhile, Commonwealth Bank of Australia has enlisted another humanoid robot, PAL Robotics' Chip, to help it carry out research into AI.",2017-04-27,"The march of the robots continues, as Canada's ATB Financial hires ... thanks to an app built by the MasterCard Labs team in Singapore.",ATB Financial introduces robot branch workers,https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/30485/atb-financial-introduces-robot-branch-workers,0

28,"Businesses in Singapore have long complained about a shortage of labor which they say has pushed up wages. Now they're seeking to push back against labor costs, replacing people, with robots.     Meet e-bot, a food delivery robot that can accept payment go down ramps and take lifts with other staring passengers.    E-bot is employed by e2i, a government agency that assists workers and employers through career guidance and job matching services. Against the backdrop of rising labor cost and a shortage of manpower, e2i wants to showcase e-bot as a possible solution for future employment in Singapore.    ""I think the issue out there is that we need something to be showcased, piloted, tested, test-bedded, so when we first did it, we had to overcome some of these challenges: how the robot communicates with the home base, how do we get the safety of the robot in place, because this is a crowded campus,"" said Gilbert Tan, CEO, Singapore Employment & Employability Institute.    Safe interaction between human and machine is key for a project like this. E-bot is smart enough to avoid obstacles, but sometimes human error could stop it from doing its job. And then, it needs a helping hand.     ""The robot has two emergency locks on the side. Perhaps someone was curious and touched the buttons. E-bot was locked in the lift for a long time. So I went to look for it and unlocked it. It walked back slowly,"" said Aisha Wong, Cafe Worker.    Singapore has allocated more than 320 million dollars to support the national robotics program since last year. The finance minister says robotics technology can enable Singapore to work more efficiently in a tight labor market. It can also create more high value-added jobs.    One company thats convinced that automation and robotics is the way forward is SATS. The airport service and in-flight catering company controls 80 percent of Changi Airports ground handling and catering business.  In the past few years, SATS has managed to grow its business but maintain labor cost, thanks to productivity measures such as robots and automated guided vehicles.  The company CEO says although technologies make the organization a lot more efficient, its the people who are leading the changes.  ""Because the technology on its own without the support of the people wont work,"" said Alexander Hungate, CEO, SATS.  ""The draw back of a lot of these new technologies is that they are fundamentally less flexible than human beings and so you need the human element to work out how they can be best used because its about complimenting the passion and the creativity of people with technology to make them more productive.""    So will robots take over human jobs in the future The answer is a definite yes and its happening now. But the good news is that they are only there to make humans more productive and more creative. After all, technology cant replace the human touch.
