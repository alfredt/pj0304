0,"In the face of a decline in manpower, the role of technology in defence is more important than ever, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen yesterday.  He was speaking at the launch of DSO Complex, the new headquarters of defence research organisation DSO National Laboratories.  With a total floor area of 69,000 sq m across two eight-storey buildings, the complex in Science Park Drive houses more than 1,000 staff working across 200 laboratories and offices, said DSO. It declined to comment on the cost of the building.  Dr Ng quoted former deputy prime minister Goh Keng Swee, who noted in 1970 that manpower constraints meant that the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) was dependent on technology.  ""If technology was important then when we had fertility rates above replacement level, how much more so now and in our future, when our manpower supply falls"" said Dr Ng.  Dr Goh had established the predecessor of DSO in 1972 when he was defence minister.  DSO Complex will play a key role in driving ""experimental laboratories"" to provide the SAF with ""indigenous and special capabilities"" to meet a wide spectrum of security challenges, said Dr Ng.  These include facilities dedicated to two key areas: artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.  The Playground - a dedicated space where DSO staff across various disciplines can explore and test ideas - features an artificial intelligence hub, which works on projects such as the use of video analytics to identify and track suspicious targets based on attributes such as height and clothing, and even one's gait.  It is also working on a platform that can profile suspected terrorists across multiple social media platforms.  DSO is currently engaging various government agencies on the implementation of the technology, said information division laboratory head Teow Loo Nin.  Meanwhile, a 500 sq m robotics laboratory allows engineers to develop and test robotic systems, prior to field trials. These include a variety of unmanned vehicle systems that can operate across land, sea and air.  Unmanned ground vehicles, developed by DSO, are able to navi- gate their way through forested areas without the benefit of GPS, said robotics autonomy programme manager Hikaru Fuji- shima. ""We had to develop complex, in-house algorithms to process the sensor data that allows the vehicles to operate in off-road environments,"" he said.  These ground vehicles can be paired with unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance and intelligence-gathering purposes.  In order to meet the changing needs of both the Ministry of Defence (Mindef) and the SAF, DSO needs to harness expertise across various science and engineering disciplines, said DSO chief executive Cheong Chee Hoo.  The new complex is designed to facilitate collaboration not only be- tween DSO scientists and engineers, but also with its partners in Mindef, SAF and other agencies, he added.",2017-04-21,"Dr Ng quoted former deputy prime minister Goh Keng Swee, who noted in 1970 that manpower constraints meant that the Singapore Armed ...",Room to work on robotics and AI in new DSO Complex,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/room-to-work-on-robotics-and-ai-in-new-dso-complex

3,"DSO National Laboratories (DSO), Singapore's largest defence R&D organisation, officially opened its new complex in Science Park Drive on Friday (Apr 21).  SINGAPORE: DSO National Laboratories (DSO) - Singapore's largest defence R&D organisation - officially opened its new complex in Science Park Drive on Friday (Apr 21).    The eight-storey twin buildings house more than 1,000 research engineers and scientists from across 200 offices and laboratories. They are also equipped with facilities that can further research in areas of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI).    This includes the Playground, a shared space where researchers and scientists can access a wide suite of technology and tools. It also comprises an Artificial Intelligence hub, which aims to raise awareness of AI and promote innovative applications of the technologies to Singapore's defence systems.    Some of these innovations include using data for maritime security and analysing social media to determine and extract intelligence to support counter-terrorism efforts.    Another key facility in the new complex is the Robotics Laboratory, a one-stop shop for engineers to embark on prototyping, integration, simulation and testing of robotic systems prior to field tests.    It is the first of its kind in Singapore, and is focused on making unmanned systems smarter and faster.  In his opening address, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen acknowledged the importance of DSO's role in the defence landscape, especially in building up new capabilities for the Next Gen Singapore Armed Forces.    ""As it did before, DSO's work must help us better prepare for challenges ahead. DSO's past efforts in AI and robotics since the 1990s have helped provide the SAF (Singapore Armed Forces) with unmanned platforms for land, sea and air,"" said Dr Ng.    ""With our increasing dependence on technology, the new DSO complex has been designed to encourage collaboration and spur innovations to meet SAF's future requirements,"" he added.  Dr Ng also went on a tour of the Playground and the Robotics Laboratory, where he witnessed a live demonstration of an unmanned air-to-ground teaming of a drone and driverless vehicle, capabilities which could soon be deployed in SAF operations.",2017-04-21,"The DSO National Laboratories (DSO) Singapore's largest defence R&D ...

6,"It's no RoboCop, but this autonomous patrol bot is going to be seen more and more often around Singapore.  Ademco, a local security services company, recently launched a rent-a-robot service, in response to fewer people signing up to work as security guards.  The 1.6m-tall robots are less like China's egg-shaped robot police, but more like a submarine, with five cameras on its long neck, two front cameras, and four wheels.  The robot can also record licence plates, as well as a 360-degree view of surrounding activities from up to 10 meters (32 feet) away.  It'll also send alerts to a 24-hour manned command center if it detects abnormalities like fire or loud sounds.  These robots are made by San Francisco-based SMP Robotics. The bots are designed to withstand Singapore's tropical climate, high heat, and humidity levels.  Ademco is hoping the robots will help offer an additional resource to its roster of human guards.  Companies can spend up to S$8,000 ($5,704) per month for two security guards covering 12-hour shifts, while the robot  which can operate nearly all day (minus charging times) would cost about S$500 ($356) less, estimates TODAY.  And unlike humans, these robots do not tire.  ""There are also limitations in human beings,"" Ademco group managing director, Toby Koh, told Channel NewsAsia.  Security staff patrol seven to eight times every 12 hours, he said. ""If I were to do a patrol 10 times a day, at some point, my ability to focus and concentrate, [to] try to identify abnormalities...is going to deteriorate.""  Perhaps more importantly, robot officers won't suffer from high turnover rates. With the long hours, Singapore is facing a shortage of security guards. In a 2014 report by the Straits Times, it's estimated that the country needed about 10,000 more guards, and security companies had to look to hiring personnel from Taiwan for armed auxiliary security services.  Patrick Lim, Ademco's director of group sales and marketing, said another reason for the high turnover is that security guards tend to get put off by some of the more mundane parts of the job over time.  If that can be replaced by machines, leaving the guards do perform more high-value skills, more people could be persuaded to stay on, he said.  Ademco's main competitor, Certis Cisco, told TODAY that it was also keen to use autonomous bots, but didn't say if it would roll out a similar service.

7,"Automated plane boarding bridges to be developed in Singapore  With rapid advancements made in robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Singapore Technologies Engineering (ST Engineering) is all set to develop automated passenger boarding bridges in five to six years. This feature will be introduced at Changi Airport which will allow passengers to move from the airport terminal gate to an airplane without being exposed to the weather.  Director of ST Engineering-NTU Corporate Lab Paul Tan said, In Singapore, during the heavy weather period you could have thunderstorms that may impede a lot of the sensor operations.  If it (the bridge) is not docked properly it could add on to delays, and in the worst case it may lead to mishaps which might damage the aircraft, he said.  Tan added, By introducing automation, we provide precision control capabilities that allow the bridge to automatically dock to the aircraft regardless of weather conditions, thereby taking away the risk of potential damage or collision with ground vehicles.  The automated passenger boarding bridges use pre-determined markings based on existing aircraft types to align the bridge with the plane  allowing it to perform under adverse weather conditions at both day and night.  He also observed, ST Engineering started looking at a whole suite of airport robotics solutions about two years ago when various authorities approached the company to introduce robotics and AI into the airport environment.  Interestingly, Changi Airport Group (CAG) announced in January, a SGD50 million programme with the Economic Development Board (EDB) to develop solutions in robotics and unmanned systems, among others, in a live airport environment.  Tan added, As part of ST Engineerings effort to help Changi Airport in its airport transformation, we are focusing our robotics and intelligence systems on the airports air side as well as the terminus side. These systems can be used at both existing and new airport terminals.  Other works in the pipeline include an automated baggage tractor for baggage handling, and a smart wheelchair convoy system. Together with the automated passenger boarding bridge, Tan said he believes the airport would be able to enhance their productivity by at least 50 per cent.",2017-04-20,"With rapid advancements made in robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Singapore Technologies Engineering (ST Engineering) is all set to ...",Automated plane boarding bridges to be developed in Singapore,http://www.connectedtoindia.com/automated-plane-boarding-bridges-to-be-developed-in-singapore-1230.html
8,"SINGAPORE - Once flooded with endless questions every day, receptionists at rental office firm Crosscoop Singapore may soon have an easier day at the office thanks to a new colleague who is literally wired for the job.  NAO, a humanoid robot, can provide a range of information from the phone numbers of recommended accounting firms to details about nearby restaurants including cuisine type and pricing. The robot, which can communicate in Japanese and English, occasionally breaks into a dance too.  NAO is just 57cm tall and bears a childlike appearance.  To access its database, visitors and tenants at Crosscoop Singapore need to select the type of information they want on a tablet placed in front of it, and the robot will provide the answer.  On Thursday (April 6), the firm gave a demonstration of NAO's abilities to the media.  NAO is on a two-month trial at the firm, a collaboration between SoftBank Telecom Singapore, Crosscoop Singapore and IT firm Nippon Jimuki. The trial ends in May.  NAO was previously on trial at MY World Preschool in Bukit Panjang, where it taught children in interactive ways, such as by dancing.  According to SoftBank Telecom Singapore - the local distributor of NAO - about 60 units of the robot, each costing about $14,000, has been sold here.  Crosscoop Singapore's hope is that NAO will help to reduce the monthly working hours of each receptionist from 160 hours to 150 hours.  The firm operates on the 10th storey of a commercial building at 80, Robinson Road.  Ms Atsuko Sato, 32, an office manager at Crosscoop Singapore, said she and other staff manning the front desk often get questions about Singapore from the 80 Japanese companies it rents office space to, including where to eat and the names of banks here.  ""Coupled with phone calls from potential customers, it is sometimes too much for us to handle, and at times we have to put people on hold,"" she said.  ""Now we can leave NAO to answer the simple questions, and we can concentrate on questions which required more detailed explanations.""",2017-04-06,"According to SoftBank Telecom Singapore - the local distributor of NAO - about 60 units of the robot, each costing about $14,000, has been ...",Humanoid robot NAO takes on receptionist tasks at rental office firm ...,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/humanoid-robot-nao-takes-on-receptionist-tasks-at-rental-office-firm-crosscoop-singapore
9,"Works are in full swing at the future Tuas port, with reclamation ongoing for two out of four phases of the development and more than 3km of caisson already installed to form the wharf.  The caisson, which sits on a foundation on the seabed, is a 28m-high concrete watertight structure - about the height of a 10-storey Housing Board block. Using caissons to build the wharf structure is faster than traditional methods like piling.  In all, 8.6km of caisson will have to be constructed under Phase 1 of the Tuas port project, which aims to grow the Singapore port, amid competition from other regional and global ports.  The new Tuas port - which will be twice the size of Ang Mo Kio town - will be opened progressively from 2021. When fully completed by 2040, it will be able to handle up to 65 million twenty-foot equivalent units of cargo a year, more than double what the port handled last year.  Work on the port, which will eventually house current operations at Pasir Panjang, Tanjong Pagar, Keppel and Brani container terminals, is proceeding as planned despite the current industry downturn.  Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) chief executive Andrew Tan told The Straits Times: ""As a small and open country, any significant changes in the global economy would affect Singapore.""  Still, Singapore has maintained its position as a global port hub and an international maritime centre, despite the current slowdown.  He said: ""PSA's volumes are holding steady, vessel arrival tonnage has increased, more ships are being flagged under our registry and bunker volumes remain high.""  Reflecting the current industry challenges, the Singapore Maritime Week 2017 officially opened yesterday with the theme Navigating Through Challenging Times.  More than 20,000 maritime professionals, including high-level delegates from port authorities, industry leaders and maritime experts, are expected to attend the programmes throughout this week.  As part of the event, members of the public can take a virtual tour of the Port Operations Control Centre which helps to secure Singapore's waters, and also watch a drone that can analyse the chemical composition of hazardous smoke.  At the opening yesterday, Senior Minister of State for Transport Josephine Teo said it is critical for the industry to band together to face challenges. For example, to meet the sector's long-term demand for talent, the Singapore Maritime Foundation is working with government agencies and private companies to offer incentives such as scholarships.  And as part of the move to Tuas, MPA is studying new technologies and automation, including the use of robotics and drones that will not only make port operations more effective and efficient, but also more attractive for those considering joining the industry.",2017-04-24,Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) chief executive Andrew ... including the use of robotics and drones that will not only make port ...,Full steam ahead for new Tuas mega port,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/full-steam-ahead-for-new-tuas-mega-port
10,"SINGAPORE - Five employers were charged in court on Tuesday (April 4) for failing to pay their employees' salaries.  They included two food and beverage firms, a construction company, a robotics firm, and a manufacturing company. The manufacturing company, Goodmate Global, faced 17 charges - the largest number among all five firms.  The others charged were 3S Restaurant, WOW Holdings, Access Builders, as well as the sole director of Infinium Robotics, Mr Woon Junyang.  Apart from not paying salaries, some firms also failed to pay salaries when their employees were dismissed, or terminated due to a breach of contract on their employers' part.  ""Employers must pay salaries on time,"" said Mr Raymond Tan, who is director of employment standards enforcement at the Manpower Ministry (MOM).  ""As in these cases, MOM will take stern action against errant employers for salary non-payment, including prosecuting those who have wilfully refused to comply with Labour Court orders or those who owed large amount of salaries to workers.""  Employers who fail to pay salaries to their employees can be fined up to $15,000, jailed up to six months, or both. The penalty can be doubled for repeat offenders.  Another case involving Mr Ching Hwa Min, a director of two companies - J S Environment Enterprise and Nam Hong Engineering - will be in court later this week, also for non-payment of salaries.

13,"Singapore has a big ambition to become a Smart Nation.  But what is a Smart Nation  On one level, it is about the exploitation of technologies in order to make the lives of people better, by giving them convenient and fast access to information and to customised services, including those that we cannot even imagine today. The current state of technology already offers all the ingredients of a Smart Nation.  But on another - I would argue more fundamental - level, being a Smart Nation calls for innovation at the systems level - aggregating technologies and combining them with new operating concepts, policies and plans - to solve national problems, such as the effects of climate change, traffic congestion, an ageing population, or simply to improve service delivery.  But its realisation is the sum of many innovations, big and small. Its ambition should be big, but its implementation is in hundreds and thousands of projects, both large and little.  But on both levels, it is a product of our imagination, and it is limited only by our imagination. Imagine a Smart Nation where there is increased efficiency, convenience and connectivity in and between workplaces and homes. Wearable technology such as hologram devices are used on the go to check and respond to work e-mails. Wi-Fi is available islandwide, eliminating restrictions from fixed data and limited call minutes. In the workplace, robots take over routine administrative tasks like coordinating meetings, conducting research and running daily errands.  At home, robotic helpers do the household chores and prepare meals. They order groceries when food items are low in stock, which are then delivered by drone to the doorstep.  Throughout Singapore, there are healthcare pods deployed islandwide at every housing block. These provide medical diagnosis, dispense medicine and provide simple medical services as well. These make it more convenient for elderly residents, who have mobility problems, and those who do not have the time to visit a clinic.  However, the Government may not be structured to reach this level of imagination and boldness of vision. Some might argue that it is not even its business. Innovation at this level is perhaps better achieved by the private sector, and by individual start-ups with the boldness and the ideas.     Dr Marcelo Ang, acting director at the National University of Singapore's Advanced Robotics Centre, with the autonomous driverless vehicle Scot, which is being tested at one-north. More test-bedding of Smart Nation technologies in real-life settings should be encouraged and organised, says the speaker. ST FILE PHOTO     Empowerment is key. Too much top-down control will kill the spirit of innovation that is central to a Smart Nation. Instead, the role of the Government should be to facilitate such innovation by funding incentives and arrangements through flexible - rather than restrictive - regulations.  A good example of this approach is the Monetary Authority of Singapore's establishment of a regulatory sandbox last year to allow fintech companies to experiment with products and services in an environment where, if an experiment fails, ""it fails safely and cheaply within controlled boundaries, without widespread adverse consequences"".  The Government also has a key role in connecting these innovations to their societal environments, by encouraging and organising test-bedding and pilots of Smart Nation technologies in real-life settings, and perhaps even by insuring the risk of some of these experiments.  In Singapore, a precinct - one-north - is now the site of a major pilot for the use of autonomous vehicles - or driverless cars - testing not just the technologies for the cars, but also for the road furniture. Such experiments and trials are essential because the development of these technologies and their applications need to be test-bedded in real environments.  If the pilot is successful, then the programme may be expanded beyond this precinct into the larger national transport system, relieving road congestion and getting people to their destinations faster - and more safely - and, like Car-Free Sunday SG, helping to realise the vision of a car-lite Singapore.  But there is a political challenge to such ambition. There are many misconceptions about the technologies associated with a Smart Nation. One big misconception is that in a 24/7 online world constantly surrounded by innumerable sensors and smart objects all connected to the Internet - the Internet of Things - absolute privacy and absolute security can be achieved.  As smart objects seek to gather more contextual information on behaviour and actions, the ability of smart devices to analyse people's lives and discover their identities will challenge traditional notions of privacy. Such information can clearly be misused and abused, compromising privacy and security.  There is another related issue - a fear, perhaps irrational in some countries and rational in others - that the government will exploit these technologies to intrude into the private lives of citizens, or to create an Orwellian system of mass state surveillance.  To overcome these misconceptions, a mature discussion is needed, not a polemical one. The Government has a central role to play in shaping this discussion. It will have to persuade citizens that the benefits outweigh the risks of exploiting these technologies, and then explain how the risks can be managed.  This is clearly in the realm of politics, and the onus must be on the political leadership to convince the people that such fears are misplaced in Singapore. But this can be achieved only if there is trust between the people and the Government. As I observed earlier, trust in a fast-changing and complex world is a vital asset to good governance.  Change cannot be avoided. Innovation must be continuous because the world does not stand still. Change and its handmaiden - innovation - must be embraced as an imperative of governance. Furthermore, there is no end point. It is a journey without a fixed destination, because the future is an ever-shifting horizon.  But people dislike change - it is human nature. Change requires leadership, because it means leading people out of their comfort zone. Getting them to change is an act of will. The future-fit leader has to persuade his people to believe in the need for change, instil confidence in change and empower his people to change.  Successful leaders of change also make their people brave enough to express their opinions, change their behaviour, take risks and learn from failure. They tolerate mavericks - even if they do not embrace them - because all future-fit organisations need mavericks. They are the ones who are prepared to challenge conventional wisdom and come up with the ideas that can change the rules of the game. Some will argue that leaders should be more tolerant of mavericks.  My response to this is: ""Yes, but only up to a point."" A maverick is a maverick only if he is fighting the establishment. If he believes enough in his ideas, he ought to have the courage and conviction of his beliefs to push them, even against resistance. If he gives up the moment he runs into some opposition or official rebuff, then in my book, he is not a maverick. I think this is a sound approach. It is essentially a Darwinian process, in which only those who have thought through their ideas and are prepared to stand up and defend them, deserve the chance of a second hearing. Some mavericks will survive.  In today's world of accelerating change - the Anthropocene - we will need to dare to dream and to experiment with things no one else has done before. We must steel ourselves to embark on journeys of discovery, in which the destinations are unknown, and we must be prepared to cope with unexpected outcomes, to experiment, to manage the risk, to fail and then to pick ourselves up and keep going.",2017-04-20,"Singapore has a big ambition to become a Smart Nation. ... acting director at the National University of Singapore's Advanced Robotics Centre, ...",A Smart Nation limited only by imagination,http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/a-smart-nation-limited-only-by-imagination
14,"Worlds collided like slabs of metal in a robotics rink as Immokalee High School competed alongside teams from Kazakhstan to New Zealand under one roof at the 10th annual VEX Robotics World Championship.  The Kentucky Exposition Center, where matches ended Saturdayin Louisville, transformed into an Olympic Village as 1,400 teams from 30 countries and 50 states decorated their booths with cultural memorabilia.  One team from Chengdu, China, lined their table with emerald bamboo shoots, while the booth directly facing them, a team from Muskogee, Oklahoma, went with a hunting theme, covering their walls in a forest green camouflage print and rubber mallard ducks.  Afew rows over, sandwiched between teams from Urumqi, China, and Carrolton, Georgia, two teams from Immokalee hovered over their metal creations, prodding them with Allen wrenches and air compressors.  The robots under operation, named Dragonzord and Megazord, were the brainchildren of a group of seven Immokalee students and their coachFred Rimmler.  Being from Immokalee, you dont really get to meet that many different people, said Dragonzord captain Kristian Trevino, 18. To meet everybody from around the world, its amazing. I think its great.  Kristian and his teammates spent countless hours after school and on weekends since September assembling and reassembling their robots out of nut and bolts, motors, rubber bands and electrical wiring.  The teams qualified for the state championship in Tampa for the first time and arrived at the world competition as underdogs. Immokalees robotics program is only in its second year, and this was the first year the team competed outside the Collier school district.  We never thought wed make it this far in the first place, said Dragonzord mechanic Isaiah Reyna, 16.  On a 12-foot-square playing field, the bots competed to see how many toy stars and cubes each could throw over to the other side in the allotted two minutes. The robots, driven by a designated team member through a game controller, can gain bonus points for climbing onto a corner post and for driving autonomously.  Team Dragonzord enjoyed a solid run, ending with a ranking of 16 out of 94 in their division after winning seven of their 10 qualifying matches. But the results were just low enough to deter the highest-ranking teams from selecting them as allies for the division finals.  Nobody knew where Immokalee was before, but now that weve started getting our name out there, were considered as one of the best teams in Florida, Isaiah said.  Megazord didnt farequite as well, winning just three of their 10 matches because of an unexplainable chronic malfunction. But the team stayed positive and were grateful for the opportunity to represent their small rural town.  Theres a lot of rumors that Immokalees a bad place. This shows that we actually do stuff here, that maybe were not just about agriculture and minorities, said Megazord mechanic George Herrera-Carrillo, 15.  Though they wont be bringing home any hardware, the teams appreciated the opportunity to work with roboticists from other countries including Canada and Singapore.  Isaiah and George enjoyed the unique experience of representing the United States in the Parade of Nations at the opening ceremonies Wednesday.  Everyone was chanting U.S.A.! U.S.A.! he said. There was a lot of excitement and adrenaline going through us.  Several team members used the occasion to explore their interest in Japanese culture and visited the countrys booth several times. The Japanese team offered them gifts including origami cranes and temporary tattoos with Japanese characters, and the teams added each other on Snapchat and Instagram (a sure sign of the beginning of a teenage friendship in 2017).  Theyre so sweet, said Dragonzord mechanic Jennifer Villa, 18. Its nice to have that camaraderie.  Jennifer was one of two girls on Immokalees teams and took part in the competitions first Girl Powered social, an event aimed at recognizing the intrepid women taking part in a male-dominated field.

16,"These are bold goals but work is underway to move towards that vision through advanced manufacturing, the Economic Development Board's (EDB) assistant managing director Lim Kok Kiang told The Business Times in an exclusive interview.  SINGAPORE has a vision: That is all factories housed in the Republic will be the most globally competitive, efficient and productive for companies.  These are bold goals but work is underway to move towards that vision through advanced manufacturing, the Economic Development Board's (EDB) assistant managing director Lim Kok Kiang told The Business Times in an exclusive interview.  For one thing, the manufacturing sector here is at an inflexion point, having reached a critical mass for the fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, to take off.  Advanced manufacturing is a fusion of new automation technologies, such as robotics, additive manufacturing and autonomous guided vehicles, with industrial Internet of Things, like cloud computing, augmented reality and machine learning.  Said Mr Lim: ""If we are successful, hopefully all plants in Singapore, especially the bigger plants, will be the most competitive plant for that company on a global basis.""  There are currently some plants in Singapore which already fit that description. ""Imagine if all plants in Singapore are actually that way,'' said Mr Lim. ""The existing plant can also, through the adoption of all these technologies over a period of time, be the most competitive plant for that company on a global basis."" This will ensure that the manufacturing sector continues to contribute 20 per cent to the country's economy.  The Committee on the Future Economy has identified advanced manufacturing as one of the key growth areas for Singapore. Under the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2020 plan, the government has set aside S$3.2 billion for advanced manufacturing and engineering.  Said Mr Lim: ""We already have a big manufacturing base in Singapore, so we are not starting from zero. These companies are constantly looking at ways to improve their manufacturing operations ... because manufacturing is not just about labour cost anymore.""  Singapore is a manufacturing base for a wide number of industries from semiconductors to motors to aircraft engines and even petrochemical plants, all of which are doing relatively well.  Productivity in the manufacturing sector is quite high compared to productivity in Singapore as an average, as the companies are competing on a global basis, Mr Lim noted.  ""A company can choose to put their factory here or in China, Germany or Japan,'' said Mr Lim. Embracing technologies will make Singapore plants more productive, efficient and competitive. Doing that also works in Singapore's favour, as it helps mitigate issues related to labour and land constraints.  ""If we want to continue to expand and be competitive in manufacturing, we must be able to do more with less because we are not able to compete on labour cost alone. And all these technologies are exactly enabling that,"" said Mr Lim.  A fusion of technologies and digitalisation enables factories to become smarter. Sensors are deployed in an industrial setting to allow the process to become more intelligent and interactive. Everything, from maintenance to quality control to monitoring energy efficiency, can be done in a more efficient way.  In predictive maintenance, for instance, sensors can detect when supplies are running low and automatically send out an order for them to be replenished, or they can detect and alert when certain parts need attention. In quality control, image sensors can pick up flaws better than the human eye, thus ensuring quality.  However, there is no one-size-fits-all, stressed Mr Lim, as each company adopts technology in a different way. He also emphasised that it is a continuous journey of improvements and enhancements, where new technologies are integrated over time to improve productivity.  Using technology also adds smartness in automation and opens up new possibilities, such as producing more variety with the same floor space, and new business models, such as customised products.  A certain degree of smartness is needed to attain a lot size of one, or customisation, which is where advanced manufacturing is moving towards.  A case in point is local small and medium enterprise, PBA Group, which has a smart factory that could manufacture its products with a lower production cost per unit than its factory in China.  Meiban Group has plans to invest about S$10 million to S$12 million to testbed solutions in robotics, automation and smart factory software, to achieve a 20 to 30 per cent rise in productivity, and subsequently scale them to its regional factories.  Mr Lim said: ""There could be a potential export of technology and solutions, but the Singapore plant is not staying still. It is continuously making another level of improvement."" In the past, technologies were successful elsewhere before they were replicated here.  He added: ""Instead of us just being fastest implementor of technology, it could be that we are also working and evolving some of these technologies ourselves and exporting them to the other plants of these companies in the region and beyond from Singapore.""  At the launch of Manufacturing Technology Asia 2017 held from April 4 to 7 at Singapore Expo, 25 companies - both manufacturing companies and technology providers - which have made strategic advanced manufacturing investments in Singapore were celebrated and recognised.  Among them was Shell Singapore, which uses drones for site inspections, data analytics and mechanisation to support its maintenance activities. Chevron Oronite's use of a wireless plant network with mobile tracking devices for employees is expected to save 30,000 man-hours each year.  As advanced manufacturing gathers pace, new jobs like data scientists are created, while low-skilled, manual intensive jobs will give way.  Said Mr Lim: ""It is about technology working with people, not technology replacing people. It needs both the workers and the engineers to bring out the best of whatever technology there is.''  Two model factories under public-private partnership with A*Star will also be set up to help SMEs with technology adoption. One will be at the Singapore Institute for Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech) while another will be at the Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC).",2017-04-16,"SINGAPORE has a vision: That is all factories housed in the Republic will ... such as robotics, additive manufacturing and autonomous guided ...",Singapore aims to house the most globally competitive plants,http://www.businesstimes.com.sg/government-economy/singapore-budget-2017/singapore-aims-to-house-the-most-globally-competitive
17,"Have you ever imagined yourself creating a complex machine part or even a human windpipe on a screen, then seeing it take on physical form right before your eyes  Or leading a team of tireless workers who need to be reprogrammed once in a while  These are jobs already being done by 3D designers and robot coordinators. Not many people have the skills to do these jobs yet, because they have not been around for long.  At least not in a big way.  But in the economy of the future, you can expect more jobs like these to be created.     Children learning how to make their own robots using Lego pieces during a holiday workshop on robotics and game design at In3Labs. Robots and computer programs are helping do jobs ranging from delivering room service to providing financial advice, and workers in some industries are already feeling the heat. ST PHOTO: LAU FOOK KONG     While it is hard to identify the specific skills students and workers need to acquire to keep up with these changes, one skill that will come in handy is the ability to continually learn new things.  As Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say said earlier this month, as businesses transform, more old jobs will be destroyed. But new jobs will be created and existing jobs will be transformed too.  What this means for workers is that instead of staying with a single employer for life, it will be common to move through multiple employers - and take on multiple careers - throughout one's working life.  ""Each time we move from one career to another career, we will have to learn new skills and adapt to a new environment to regain our employability, time and time again,"" Mr Lim said.  Understandably, many workers are worried about adapting to these changes, and concerned about how their livelihoods will be affected.  With robots and advanced computer programs helping do jobs ranging from delivering room service to providing financial advice, workers in some industries are already feeling the heat.  But technology also creates new products, such as 3D printing for companies to make prototypes quickly rather than outsourcing this process, and jobs, such as for rapid prototyping technicians.  Jobs will disappear. But better- quality ones will be created.  For example, in advanced manufacturing, some 23,000 jobs are forecast to be displaced over the next seven years, but more than 22,000 new jobs are expected to be created.  These new jobs will pay on average 50 per cent more than those lost, a recent study by Boston Consulting Group found.  SKILLING UP FOR NEW JOBS  However, these changes wrought by technology and other forces also mean the job market will go through some labour pains.  Layoffs last year rose to the highest level since the global financial crisis in 2009. Unemploy- ment involving Singapore residents also crept up slightly.  Professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) are hit harder by the churn as it takes longer to train for a different job at these levels.  People who took a break from work, or who struggled to find a new job after being laid off, often have a hard time proving that they have the relevant knowledge and skills for a job.  This is why the Government is putting more resources into helping this group find new jobs, such as by subsidising their wages via the Career Support Programme.  PMETs can also work and get training at the same time through over 50 Professional Conversion Programmes in sectors that are expected to grow in the near future.  Unlike in the past, a degree is no longer a guarantee of lifelong employment in a well-paying job.  But opportunities are there for those who excel in technical skills to do well, even if they may not have academic qualifications.  Being quick to pick up new skills will help students and workers adapt to changing opportunities. This entails going deeper to master a chosen field and excel in it.  One tip experts have for workers is to keep abreast of the latest trends and technology, which can help bring in new ideas for employers to try out and add value.  At the same time, they recommend picking up transferrable skills that can be applied in other jobs or industries, such as being able to understand and use data, or to market an idea.  The Committee on the Future Economy has called for more opportunities for workers to acquire deep skills and use them on the job.  A medley of initatives is available to help students and workers upgrade their skills and knowledge, including study awards, work-study programmes, internships and career guidance from as early as primary school.  The $500 SkillsFuture Credit given to all Singaporeans aged 25 and above can be used to defray the cost of over 18,000 training courses.  Other measures have been put in place to help those who have years of work experience, but may not have the skills needed in sunrise industries, find new jobs.  One is the new Attach And Train programme announced in this year's Budget for up-and-coming industries like logistics. Workers can be trained while on attachments at companies that are not ready to hire staff yet.  As more focus is placed on pushing Singapore companies to break out of the local market and start creating products and services for the region and beyond, students and workers will also be encouraged to innovate and learn to work with overseas partners.  Policymakers, too, are constantly trying to learn more about what the future holds for Singapore's workforce.  Data is one aid they hope to use to help answer questions like these: How much investment is Singapore getting How many jobs will these create Which industries and companies will grow What skills will workers need for these jobs  Answers to these questions will help better prepare workers for jobs and later match them to jobs.  The National Trades Union Congress started a Future Jobs, Skills and Training unit this year to gather data on specific companies and industries where new investments and jobs will be over a three-year time frame.  The research will be shared with training providers and institutes of higher learning that can use the information to develop more relevant skills and training courses.  There have also been calls to use the data from the job posts on the national Jobs Bank more fully. For example, if a vacancy for a particular type of job is hard to fill and keeps getting re-posted, that could mean more Singaporeans need more skills in that area.  The Manpower Ministry has also made it compulsory, since Jan 1, for companies to report retrenchments within five working days, if five or more staff are retrenched within six months. This is so that the Government and unions can act on the data and offer the affected workers help more quickly.  If we wait for skills gaps to appear before workers start training for them, there will always be a lag time and the risk of structural unemployment - where the available skills of workers and the skills needed to fill jobs do not match.  That is why Singapore is trying to stay ahead of the curve.  It has rolled out Industry Transformation Maps to chart strategies for 23 industries, covering over four-fifths of the nation's gross domestic product.  Six have been launched, for the logistics, hotels, precision engineering, food manufacturing, food services and retail industries.  These should provide some guidance for companies.  The education system also needs to be tightly integrated with industry needs, all the way from schools to adult education and training centres, to provide guidance for students and workers.  For all the efforts by the Government, individuals, too, must take responsibility for their careers, and not have a sense of entitlement.  When changes come, those who can pick up new skills quickly will fare better.  So if there is any skill to get better at, it is the ability to keep learning.

18,"A new automated check-in kiosk that will be introduced at Changi Airports Terminal 4.  From deploying roving check-in agents with portable printers at Changi Airport to ease queues, to adopting 3D printing for aircraft spare parts, Singapore has unveiled a masterplan to transform the aviation industry.  Other projects being explored include remote air traffic control technology that could eventually allow integrating operations of two control towers, as well as the use of automated aerobridge docking.  Led by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), with support from Changi Airport Group, ground handlers, airlines and other stakeholders, the Air Transport Industry Transformation Map has two objectives: create better jobs and career opportunities for workers, and support the sector's growth and competitiveness.  Unveiling the plan at the Aviation Community Reception yesterday evening, Second Minister for Transport Ng Chee Meng said the sector has done well but the future will be challenging.  ""A business-as-usual approach will not do also because of our inherent constraints of land and manpower. For example, under 'business as usual', we will need to hire 10,000 more workers over the next decade.  ""This will be very difficult, given the shortage of manpower in Singapore,"" he said.  Between now and 2025, the target is to increase productivity by about 40 per cent and redesign or create 8,000 ""good jobs"", with more positions for professionals, technicians and cabin crew, he said.  For workers to become more productive, he urged firms to ramp up the use of technology such as robotics to ease physically demanding and manual tasks in airport operations.  ""Systems will talk more to each other, and more autonomous systems will support our work.  ""We want to track every piece of baggage, cargo and equipment moving across the airport in real time. Airport staff equipped with mobile devices and smart wearables can then locate them more swiftly,"" he explained.  He added that while it is an ambitious goal, the Government plans to grow the economic value created by the sector from about $7 billion today to $8 billion by 2020.  CAAS director-general Kevin Shum said there will be close collaboration with tripartite partners - companies and unions - to implement the plans.  The chairman of NTUC's aerospace and aviation cluster, Mr Ong Hwee Liang, said he hopes more workers will seize the new opportunities and adopt lifelong learning in their working life to stay relevant, productive and employable.  Mr Ng Chin Hwee, Singapore Airlines' executive vice-president (human resources and operations), noted that the industry initiative is timely, given current challenges.  Overcapacity in the skies remains a challenge and continues to put pressure on yields, while on the ground, traffic growth continues to add pressure on the infrastructure and manpower needs.  ""These challenges require a transformation plan that will enable Changi Airport, the airlines and other aviation partners to handle the traffic volume with higher productivity and cost efficiency while delivering a high-quality experience for travellers,"" he said.

19,"The city-state will also host an inaugural Defence Technology Summit in 2018 as it looks to become a global player in modern military advancements.  SINGAPORE: A starting seed grant of S$45 million a year will be given to two new laboratories in the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and DSO National Laboratories organisations, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in Parliament on Friday (Mar 3).    Modern militaries are powered by technology, and the next-generation SAF (Singapore Armed Forces), even more so, he said. Our defence technology organisations will gear up to support changes.    To foster more experimentation and innovation, DSO will set up a robotics lab in April this year and DSTA will expand to include an analytics and artificial intelligence lab.    At the former, defence engineers will collaborate on prototyping, integration, simulation and testing of systems prior to field trials for the SAF. The work on robotics has already begun, said Dr Ng. Six Singapore Infantry Regiment soldiers are currently experimenting with unmanned aerial and ground vehicles to perform missions. The Navy has gone further and is putting Unmanned Surface Vehicles which can navigate and avoid collisions autonomously into operations.    The SAF, working with the Ministry of Home Affairs, has already developed countermeasures to potential drone attacks. These systems were deployed in the last NDP (National Day Parade).    DSTAs new lab will exploit the real-time information that can be derived from the Internet of Things and platforms, said the minister.    The realisable potential is enormous. For instance, our Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre monitors more than 1,500 commercial shipping vessels in our waters daily. It uses AI to generate unique signatures for each, through collating information from multiple sources, including social media. It then detects any deviations from this signature, he explained.    This AI-embedded method detected a possible ISIS supporter on board a tanker in 2015. That person was barred from disembarking in Singapore. Finding this needle in a big haystack is only possible through modern means.    Singapore will also host an inaugural Defence Technology Summit in early 2018. Targeted as a biennial event, the summit will be organised by DSTA together with Singapores universities, A*STAR and Government agencies like GovTech, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, National Research Foundation and Singapore Economic Development Board.    Singapore can lead in defence technology, even though we are small, said Dr Ng. The Summit will provide a global platform to invite leading figures and luminaries to come share their views, provide a window into the future, allow us the opportunity to network and increase our access to new ideas and innovation.    In his speech, Dr Ng also revealed that Singapore has around 5,000 defence engineers and scientists, with the number of related scholarships and awards on offer due to be increased by 40 per cent - up to 170 from 120 today - by 2025.",2017-03-02,"The work on robotics has already begun, said Dr Ng.

22,"Businesses in Singapore have long complained about a shortage of labor which they say has pushed up wages. Now they're seeking to push back against labor costs, replacing people, with robots.     Meet e-bot, a food delivery robot that can accept payment go down ramps and take lifts with other staring passengers.    E-bot is employed by e2i, a government agency that assists workers and employers through career guidance and job matching services. Against the backdrop of rising labor cost and a shortage of manpower, e2i wants to showcase e-bot as a possible solution for future employment in Singapore.    ""I think the issue out there is that we need something to be showcased, piloted, tested, test-bedded, so when we first did it, we had to overcome some of these challenges: how the robot communicates with the home base, how do we get the safety of the robot in place, because this is a crowded campus,"" said Gilbert Tan, CEO, Singapore Employment & Employability Institute.    Safe interaction between human and machine is key for a project like this. E-bot is smart enough to avoid obstacles, but sometimes human error could stop it from doing its job. And then, it needs a helping hand.     ""The robot has two emergency locks on the side. Perhaps someone was curious and touched the buttons. E-bot was locked in the lift for a long time. So I went to look for it and unlocked it. It walked back slowly,"" said Aisha Wong, Cafe Worker.    Singapore has allocated more than 320 million dollars to support the national robotics program since last year. The finance minister says robotics technology can enable Singapore to work more efficiently in a tight labor market. It can also create more high value-added jobs.    One company thats convinced that automation and robotics is the way forward is SATS. The airport service and in-flight catering company controls 80 percent of Changi Airports ground handling and catering business.  In the past few years, SATS has managed to grow its business but maintain labor cost, thanks to productivity measures such as robots and automated guided vehicles.  The company CEO says although technologies make the organization a lot more efficient, its the people who are leading the changes.  ""Because the technology on its own without the support of the people wont work,"" said Alexander Hungate, CEO, SATS.  ""The draw back of a lot of these new technologies is that they are fundamentally less flexible than human beings and so you need the human element to work out how they can be best used because its about complimenting the passion and the creativity of people with technology to make them more productive.""    So will robots take over human jobs in the future The answer is a definite yes and its happening now. But the good news is that they are only there to make humans more productive and more creative.

24,"To perfect their attacks, some of Japans top volleyball players are training against a robot that can mimic the tactics of opposing teams.  The Japanese Volleyball Associations block machine consists of three pairs of robotic arms that move side to side in front of the net. These represent blockers  players who defend against spikes from the attacking team that send the ball forcefully over the net, making it hard for opposing players to return it.  A spike is the most effective way to win points in volleyball, says Laura Woodruff at Volleyball England. The blockers job is to try to make part of the court unavailable to the attacker, whilst the attacker has to try to find space to hit the ball into.  If the attacker gets it right, the ball flies over the net and straight onto the ground to win a point. If a blocker intercepts it, they can smash it right back over.  Developed by researchers at the Japanese Volleyball Association and the University of Tsukuba, the block machine lets a coach program the robot arms for different training drills. If they think their team could have handled a situation in a previous game better, they can recreate the moment by positioning the arms to stand in for opposition team members. They can also mimic the tactical styles of future opponents.  To start the action, the coach presses a button and the robot arms whizz independently into place. The machine can travel 3.7 metres per second, which is faster than a player can move from one position on the court to another.  Six players from Japans womens volleyball team used the robot in training sessions over eight days. Some players said they felt little difference between playing against the machine and attacking in a real game.  But because the machines configuration is set before the attack, the robot blockers can end up in the wrong position if the practice drill is slightly displaced on the court. The researchers plan to remedy this by adding motion sensors to the machine that could automatically adjust its position.They will present their work at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation in Singapore that starts in May.  It is a very sophisticated device with positive feedback overall from players, says Luca Paolo Ardig at the University of Verona, Italy.

But a robot does it in four hours.  Such industrial robots are increasingly being used on the factory floor, prompting the introduction of a new training programme.  Announced yesterday, its aim is to train more than 2,000 professionals, managers, executives and technicians in the next two years to operate and implement automated production systems.  The training will be done by the Robotics Application Centre of Excellence (Race), a collaboration between professors from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and local precision engineering company PBA Group.  Said Race chief executive Derrick Yap: ""South-east Asia has been earmarked to be the factory of the world and Singapore, being at the epicentre of the region, is very well-positioned (to take advantage of this).""  The series of courses under the new Robotics Applications Training and Education Programme starts on Jan 11, with a one-day ""novice"" level session for people without any technical background in robotics and automation. They will learn about technology trends and how to analyse the cost-effectiveness of adopting robotics and automation. The session costs $50 for Singaporeans, after subsidies.  The next two higher-level courses, each to run for five days, will be launched in March, with another two to follow later.

Mr Tonby said Industry 4.0 describes four broad disruptions. They are: increasing data availability and interconnectivity; analytics and business intelligence (BI) capabilities, including artificial intelligence (AI); advanced human-machine interactions such as cobots (a collaborative robot that interacts with humans in the workplace); and advanced production methods such as 3-D printing.  All these are expected to transform the entire life cycle of a business' product, from customer order to after-sales.  The Singapore centre is part of a global network of five DCCs that McKinsey has around the world. The Singapore centre will be in partnership with A*Star's Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC) and, apart from Singapore, will also serve the South-east Asian region. McKinsey is spending US$15 million upfront in establishing the centre and will employ 10 new full-time employees. According to sources close to the project, McKinsey expects that more investments in the centre will be ongoing as it expands and increases its scope. Most of the money is likely to go into hiring more skilled personnel.  Talking to The Business Times, Mr Tonby noted that with manufacturing accounting for one-fifth of Singapore's economic output, ""the facility is in line with the nation's push to become a regional hub for advanced manufacturing (AM)"".  He added: ""Singapore, in our view, is also uniquely positioned to become the home of smart manufacturing pilots. The DCC is also designed to be especially relevant to regionally important sectors including discrete manufacturing, semiconductors, oil and gas, electric power, and mining.  ""We see DCC Singapore playing an integral role in the ecosystem, drawing on ARTC's state-of-the-art facilities and research and development capabilities across A*Star, ranging from manufacturing, data analytics, virtual process modelling, and digital solutions for complex manufacturing processes.""  David Low, ARTC's CEO, told BT that his organisation would be jointly conducting manpower training sessions with McKinsey for companies to get an appreciation of lean manufacturing and Industry 4.0.  ""These sessions will leverage DCC's learning modules across themes such as predictive maintenance, digitised performance management, procurement and supply chain. The DCC will utilise part of ARTC's Model Factory testbed that will be launched in the later part of the year,"" Mr Low said.  The Model Factory testbed will provide a learning environment for companies to experience advanced manufacturing technologies, so that they can acquire and deepen their knowledge and skills in such technologies, thereby reducing the risks involved in adopting AM in their own factories and processes  ARTC will also groom talent for Future of Manufacturing technologies through workshops and on-the-job training. At any one time, ARTC has at least 30 interns from the various Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) such as NTU (Nanyang Technological University), NUS (National University of Singapore, SUTD (Singapore University of Technology and Design), Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Nanyang Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic.  As new technologies such as robotics, digitalisation, IoT (Internet of Things) and analytics come online, the manufacturing sector is changing dramatically. Advanced manufacturing is one of the areas identified by the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) as a growth cluster. CFE noted that Singapore should augment its current base of complex manufacturing capabilities, and prepare its workforce to take on the jobs created by the integration and adoption of AM technologies.  Recently German semiconductor giant, Infineon Technologies, announced that it is spending 70 million euros (S$104.8 million) in five years till 2021 to develop a smart factory at its backend manufacturing plant in Singapore. Infineon said it would progressively increase the level of automation, connectivity and control within the factory. It added that Industry 4.0 ""is not only the next step in automation, but will substantially change how we work; machines are becoming more intelligent and will be able - to a large extent - to control and optimise themselves and the production process in which they are involved"".  McKinsey's Mr Tonby said the company's DCCs around the world will simulate different companies, depending on the needs of the region. ""For example, the Singapore facility will feature a gearbox manufacturer whereas the German facility will feature a woven smart wristband producer. Ultimately, the realistic production environment is the biggest differentiator as all centres will feature similar capability learning modules which will be developed in synergy and then tailored to the simulated business.""  He added that the Singapore centre will showcase applications beyond the four pillars of Industry 4.0 - data analytics, robotics, 3-D printing and connectivity - to ""include technologies that can be adopted across the entire value chain encompassing product development, procurement and supply chain"".  The Singapore facility will offer companies at different stages of their Industry 4.0 transformations with the following help:  Among the many technology showcases on offer at the DCC, one will be on predictive maintenance. ""New technology today uses real time data to predict and prevent breakdowns and can reduce down time by 50 per cent. At the DCC, participants will learn about these new technologies and also pilot them on site, before applying them to their own setting. We think this approach can be transformational in the adoption of Industry 4.0,"" Mr Tonby said.  ARTC's Mr Low noted that Industry 4.0 is still a relatively new concept and not all companies are convinced of the value that these technologies can bring them.  Companies need to understand how they will be left behind if they do not adopt Industry 4.0, as the future of manufacturing will see a move towards the replacement of labour-intensive processes with disruptive technologies such as digital manufacturing, robotics and automation, he said, adding: ""To remain relevant, companies must identify and learn about the types of advanced technologies which can make a significant difference to their businesses, and open up new revenue streams.""  Mr Low added that with strong government support in this space, along with a well integrated ecosystem of relevant government agencies, researchers and the industry, Singapore is in a good position in the adoption of Industry 4.0.

27,"Hoteliers are worried about the lacklustre economic growth, not to mention the expected modest growth of 4% for tourist arrivals in 2017.  As one of the worlds top meeting spots and financial hubs, it seems that Singapore is never in danger of extreme declines in visitor arrivals. Its booming hospitality industry is supported by 33,000 individuals working to provide the worlds top decision makers, foremost companies, and the city-states regular visitors the best hospitality services and deals.  However, with the rapid growth of other cities around the world and in the region, Singapores hotel industry needs to keep evolving and innovating if it longs to keep its coveted spot in the hospitality business, particularly in the meetings, incentives, conferencing, and exhibitions (MICE) sector. A report by DBS Bank reveals that 2017 is going to be a challenging year for the tourism sector, with a modest growth of 4% for tourist arrivals.  With the carryover of new hotels which were originally scheduled to open in 2016 into 2017, our earlier expectation of a more balanced market in 2017 is likely to be delayed into 2018 where the supply of new hotels drops off. The decline in new room supply in 2018 is due to the lack of new land released by the Singapore government for hotel developments over the past two years, says Derek Tan, vice president at DBS Bank, Group Equity Research.  Stiff competition exists in the hotel industry as supply increases and despite economic uncertainties in the region and beyond. According to the UNWTO Tourism Highlights of 2016, the global hotel industry remains to grow, thereby providing opportunities for local companies to amass revenue through internationalisation. With the growth of the hospitality industry, hoteliers are then expected to keep up and provide creative solutions as customers continue to change and reevaluate their expectations.  Singapore faces increased competition from other tourism markets through a variety of factors which include easier access to other countries through the relaxation of visa restrictions, like multiple entry visas for Chinese visitors into Japan; devaluation of the other regional currencies, potentially making it cheaper to visit other countries compared to Singapore, e.g. a weaker Korean won and Japanese yen; and Singapore already having a high market share, e.g. Singapore accounts for 38%-39% of total Indonesian outbound travel, explains Tan.  Rethinking business   Frank Sorgiovanni, head of research Asia Pacific, JLL Hotels & Hospitality Group, says that Singapores hotel industry is very similar to Hong Kong in that tightly held hotel stock amongst generational owners sees little investment activity. He notes that investors have begun shifting their focus to other markets like Australia. Two of the most preferred investment markets for 2017 are Japan and Australia, followed by Thailand, Vietnam, and the Maldives. In the Indian Ocean, investor interest is expected to go beyond the highly soughtafter Maldives with a renewed focus shifting to the Seychelles and Mauritius resort markets.  The Hotel Industry for Sustainable Growth, a report by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB), mentions that the city-states hoteliers must be abreast of the current trends and the pressing issues in the hospitality industry in order to encourage investment.  According to STB, hotels must leverage technology and analytics, reevaluate business processes and models, enhance customer experience and engagement, and create differentiated value propositions, amongst others. Across the city-states hotel industry, STB found impressive examples of innovation from different hotels. With the rise of digital and the growing Internet of Things, hotels can look to technology to address customer demands and industry-wide concerns.  Park Avenue Rochester achieved man-hour savings of up to 3.5 fulltime employees by deploying two robots to transport housekeeping linen, refuse, and bulky items for the hotels back of house functions. The robots helped room attendants focus on cleaning and eliminated the roles of performing tedious tasks. Amidst the digital revolution and the slow growth of hospitality workforce, automation is inevitable.  Data analytics has also become one of the biggest buzzwords across all industries in the global economy. From power companies to banks and now the hospitality industry, data analytics allows executives to make decisions based on highly-detailed customer profiling. In Singapore, The Fullerton Hotels were able to automate tedious reports generation and carry out in-depth analyses across different departments. Insights generated can allow hotels to cater to the most specific tastes of customers by identifying specific services which may be developed and enhanced.  Singapores luxury hotels will also see growth in 2017, with most of the new rooms under the Upscale and Luxury segments, says Tan. Compared to 2016, there may be more pricing discipline due to constraints by these upper-tier brands to cut room rates without affecting their brand status. As such, luxury hotels will continue to roll out new services and collaborate with wellknown brands around the globe to attract more foreign visitors. We are delighted to be the first luxury hotel in Asia Pacific to partner with La Mer to offer the best in skincare and indulgent facial treatments. The coveted La Mer Miracle Broth facial will be available exclusively at The Ritz-Carlton Spa, says Peter Mainguy, general manager of The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore.  Meanwhile, Marina Bay Sands The Shoppes continued to expand with the addition of Kenzo Kids, Stella McCartney, and Paul Smith Junior. Ian Wilson, senior vice president, Hotel Operations, Marina Bay Sands, says the ArtScience Museum also saw a significant 83% increase in overall museum visitorship following the launch of its new permanent exhibition, Future World: Where Art Meets Science.  Going forward   Looking ahead to the first half of 2017, OCBC Investment Research believes the room supply injection will not be adequately matched by a growth in demand. It says 2,956 rooms are expected to be added in 1H17 and an additional 811 rooms in 2H17, against the room stock of 63,518 at the end of 2016.  FY16 visitor days were up 2.2% year-on-year on the back of 7.7% increase in tourist arrivals. Going forward, we expect leisure demand to show mild to no growth, with STB forecasting a 0% to 2% increase in tourist arrivals and a 1% to 4% increase in tourism receipts. On the other hand, corporate demand is expected to remain soft, notes OCBC in a report. Meanwhile, DBS says the demand and supply situation in Singapore is likely to become more balanced only in 2018, when supply pressures ease and new room inventory is projected to only increase by 2%. Data from Singapores Urban Redevelopment Authority shows that in the fourth quarter of 2016, 6,496 rooms were in the pipeline, 5,841 rooms under construction, and 655 were planned development.  Who made it to SBRs list   Marina Bay Sands remains at the top spot with a total number of rooms at 2,561. The Sands Expo hosted a total of 3,500 events, including numerous newto-Singapore and returning shows. Hotel Boss and Swisstel The Stamford both retain their top 2 and 3 spots with 1,500 and 1,261 rooms, respectively. Mandarin Orchard Singapore and Carlton Hotel Singapore placed fourth and fifth, respectively.  The hotel industry remains a key pillar of Singapores economic growth. In order to stay competitive, Marina Bay Sands continues to make progress as we pursue a manpowerlean business model by employing new technologies, analytics, and robotics. We strive to do our part to increase productivity within the hospitality industry, says Wilson. Marina Bay Sands saw a 3.2% increase in its hotel occupancy, clocking in 97.3% hotel occupancy in 2016 across 2,561 hotel rooms and suites. Our priority for 2017 is to continue sharpening our integrated resort business model by enhancing our guests touch points across the property, building loyalty to encourage repeat visitation, and innovating to be even more efficient operationally, notes Wilson.",2017-04-10,"The robots helped room attendants focus on cleaning and eliminated ...

28,"Drivers headed to Robinson Towers in the Central Business District will no longer have to worry about wasting time circling the building's carpark for a vacant space.  When the building reopens in the fourth quarter of next year, after a five-year redevelopment, it will feature a new automated system that makes use of robots to park cars.  Guided by lasers, cameras and markings on the ground, the robots will ferry cars of up to 2,600kg from a drop-off point to one of 90 parking spaces.  The system, developed by engineering firm MHE-Demag, is believed to be the first such application of the technology in Singapore.  Though such robots have been used for several decades to transport goods, the technology has more recently made inroads into carparks in the United States and Germany.  The system could increase the capacity of a carpark by more than 40 per cent as it allows cars to be parked closer together. The relatively small size of the robot - 5m long and 2.1m wide - also allows it to manoeuvre in narrow spaces.  Unlike other mechanised parking systems, this one does not require steel supporting structures or parking pallets, said MHE-Demag sales and markets regional director Klaus Schilling.  ""No additional building provision is required for the system and it can be adapted into a conventional parking provision in any building development easily,"" he said.  While the firm declined to say how much it will cost, a similar system by Chinese firm Yee Fung Automation - introduced in Nanjing last December - is said to have a price tag of around $200,000.  But the parking fee at Robinson Towers will be ""similar"" to other carparks in the area, said Mr Schilling.  Across the road, at CapitaGreen, daytime parking costs $3.10 a half-hour on weekdays.  Conventional mechanised parking systems - which use mechanical car lifters to move a car to a storage space - can be found at several locations here, including three Housing Board carparks in Changi Village, Yishun and Bukit Panjang.  During peak periods, retrieving a car from these carparks can take 10 to 15 minutes.  MHE-Demag said its system offers faster parking and retrieval, and the average time to retrieve a car - which can be done with a mobile app - will be about two minutes.  The firm is looking at introducing the technology at ""several other locations"", but did not disclose details, and has also started to introduce it elsewhere in the region.  Robotics expert Marcelo Ang said that while it will make parking more convenient, the high cost of purchasing and maintaining such a system could deter widespread adoption of the technology.  ""Building owners will have to weigh how much it costs against what benefits it will bring,"" said Dr Ang, who is acting director of the National University of Singapore's Advanced Robotics Centre.",2017-02-07,"Guided by lasers, cameras and markings on the ground, the robots will ... of the National University of Singapore's Advanced Robotics Centre.",Where carpark valet is a robot,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/where-carpark-valet-is-a-robot

34,"Mr Yap: ""We don't try to jump, we don't try to skip the stages, we try to move through each stage very quickly.""  FROM distributing mechanical and automation products to now manufacturing its own products using advanced manufacturing, PBA Group has grown by leaps and bounds in its 30 years of history.  Now, it has set up a training centre to help other small and medium enterprises (SMEs) like itself join the Industry 4.0 revolution.  Derrick Yap, chief executive officer of PBA Group, said the company's transformation was done progressively by taking small steps each time the company moved up the value chain.  Mr Yap told The Business Times: ""We didn't feel just doing distribution is a viable business model. I thought this kind (of work) has very little value-add, especially (when) the Internet and web-selling started to take off, it means the world is becoming borderless. I thought distributors would serve less and less purpose.""  The company then went into having its own product range by undertaking research and development (R&D) to build machines like robotics.  Mr Yap said: ""We took up the challenge and we were quite brave to move into another new field, but (we were) not completely diversified, (we were still) related to the field we were used to. From there, we went one step further and again one step further.""  Thus, from buying and selling products, it moved into contract manufacturing, and then designing and then component manufacturing.  Mr Yap felt that instead of assembling other people's components, the company should build and own the intellectual property (IP) for the components, which it did.  He said: ""Then we are able to give customers a complete solution. Now we can use the parts that we distribute, assemble into a plate where we machine design the entire module with our engineers, use components that we own and (for which) we have IP, into a solution for our customers.""  Besides making strides vertically, it has also expanded its footprint horizontally and geographically.  From the industrial space, it moved into the aerospace industry and has also made a mark in regional countries like Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, China and Taiwan.  Said Mr Yap: ""It is the same logic . . . that we progressed vertically and horizontally step-by-step.  ""We don't try to jump, we don't try to skip the stages, we try to move through each stage very quickly. Many people say we still have the speed of a startup, even though we are established.""  Although it is now a 500-strong company, it strives to be as lean as a startup, and is still nimble, active and quick to respond to changes.  Said Mr Yap: ""That is done by empowering all the individuals and managers so that they can react very fast.""  The company's staff are hands on and passionate, and have a great sense of ownership about the business.  He added: ""We tend to run in such a way that we only tell you where we want to go. How you go there is your path. So people have a lot of leeway. It's kind of like in a startup.""  Mr Yap is aware of the competition in the global arena and has decided that advanced manufacturing is the way to go, which has enabled it to reap a lower production cost per unit in Singapore than its China factory.  Its smart factory here is able to manufacture in ""high-mix, low-volume"" - ie many different products in small batches - even in a limited space of 5,000 sq ft.  He said: ""If your production line is highly automated, the cost of your product is the cost of the equipment amortised over x number of years over x number of products you are producing in that production line.  ""If my equipment cost is the same in Singapore, Malaysia and China, then it won't really matter where my factory is anymore.""  The initial phase of adopting new technologies has not been easy but the company persevered. It has gone through the early stage and is now reaping a lot of benefits from automation.  Mr Yap said: ""For us, I would like to think that it didn't last as long as other companies would have to go through because we already have all the engineers in-house.  ""The only difficult part was we had to choose long-term profit over short -term profit. We had to choose to incur all the costs, we had to choose to not provide solutions to external customers but use our engineers to provide solutions internally.""

Welcome to the new era of manufacturing, on display this week in an exhibition at the Singapore Expo.  Manufacturing Technology Asia 2017, which opened yesterday, aims to bring businesses large and small, technology providers and service firms together to share experiences and opportunities.  It is in part prompted by the potential created by technological advances.  By interacting with seasoned industry players, businesses will gain a better idea on how advanced manufacturing technologies may be adopted in their own operations.  The event, organised by trade event organiser UBM SES, will also allow businesses to explore technologies already available on the market, connect with providers and work on new solutions.  The exhibition, which comprises 301 companies from 26 countries, is showcasing a spectrum of innovative technology, including additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), optics and photonics, precision engineering and semiconductor manufacturing.  Mr Johan de Villiers, managing director of technology provider ABB, said: ""Adopting new technology is absolutely essential for firms.  ""It ensures the competitiveness of Singapore in a global economy. For a country with limited resources, the ability to use technology will continue to be a key competitive advantage for Singapore.  ""It also presents a key export opportunity for Singapore as it develops a workforce that adds value in the digital environment. Those skills are going to be a large part of the future global economy.""  Ms Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry, mentioned at the opening ceremony the importance of preparing Singapore's manufacturing sector for technological developments.  She said: ""Advanced manufacturing presents significant opportunities for our economy, companies and people.

36,"Cage-free, user-friendly collaborative robot arms affordable for enterprises of all sizes have now become the market driver within industrial robotics. The 2016 annual result of Universal Robots is a testament to that market growth, with revenue reaching DKK 662 million (US$98.4 million) and delivering a profit of DKK 92 million (US$13.7 million) before tax.  President of Universal Robots, Jrgen von Hollen, considers net income to be satisfactory and expects revenue growth of 50 percent or greater in 2017, which means that the company will stay on target to reach DKK 1 billion (US$148.6 million) by the end of 2017.  We need to stay ahead of the curve and drive innovation in everything we do. Scaling the business to continue to deliver growth year-after-year is a key priority. Compared to 2015, we have more than tripled our investments in 2016, especially in R&D, enabling us to maintain our product leadership position, and allowing us to offer the cobot technology platform of choice, said Jrgen von Hollen. Equally important has been our continued investment of more than 50 percent into the Universal Robots staff resource base in 2016, extending our capability, know-how and reach globally.  Universal Robots continues to gain market share in developing markets, doubling its global presence with local offices in 11 countries, up from five offices in 2015. The company is now represented with a presence in the USA, Spain, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, China, Singapore, India, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. The company also continues to scale a strong distribution channel covering more than 50 countries worldwide.  Eight years after Universal Robots sold its first cobot, the global collaborative robot market has entered a new phase of growth. Before the invention of the cobot, automation of manufacturing facilities was limited to highly structured tasks. As a result, many industries had to rely on hand assembly for the more dynamic and flexible functions in their production processes. However, with the Universal Robots cobot, companies are now able to apply flexible, easy-to-use, safe technology allowing them to scale and grow their businesses.  The advantage of Universal Robots cobot is its universal application for all sizes of companies, from small to large. Our technology has been an enabler for all companies  not just large corporations  to integrate automation into their production processes. What also differentiates us has been our focus on growing a global eco-system of technology partners in our UR+ platform. The UR+ platform offers customers access to application solutions leveraging a global developer resource base that is continuously innovating, said Jrgen von Hollen.  As a first mover and leading cobot manufacturer, Universal Robots has been able to rapidly grow its global market share, taking advantage of the impressive growth of the market to date. We are committed to grow our market share as the collaborative robot market experiences continued, explosive growth over the coming years as small and medium businesses adopt cobot technology, said Jrgen von Hollen.  In the spring of 2015,Teradyne, a leading supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications, acquired Universal Robots. The close collaboration between Teradyne and Universal Robots has allowed Universal Robots to leverage Teradynes global coverage and capabilities.  Universal Robots was co-founded in 2005 by the companys CTO, Esben stergaard, who wanted to make robot technology accessible to all by developing small, user-friendly, reasonably priced, flexible industrial robots that are safe to workwith. Since the first robot was launched in 2008, the company has experienced considerable growth with the user-friendly robots now sold in more than 50 countries worldwide.

37,"A team of 10 students from Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School (Secondary) (PLMGS) remembers the ""welcome"" they received when they entered the competition area for a regional robotics competition in Indonesia.  They were laughed at.  ""We were the only girls in a sea of boys,"" said Secondary 3 student Tan Jia Min, 15.  Pitted against over 300 boys from various Asian countries at August's World Robot Games, the girls set to work. ""At first we felt intimidated,"" admits 15-year-old Ling Yin, also in Sec 3. ""But we just kept trying.""  After tinkering with wires and voltages, and putting their robots through various obstacles, the team emerged victorious four days later, clinching 15 awards across 34 categories at the annual competition.  For the girls, the wins showed how far they had come in a short time. The school's robotics group had been established less than a year before.  When Mr Indra Ahmad, the school's Mathematics and Design and Technology teacher received an invitation for an earlier robotics contest in 2015, he decided to put together a group of students who were interested to give it a shot.  ""I didn't know anything about robotics then,"" said Sec 3 student Lee Wen, 15. ""But I grew to love it.""  After two months of preparation, the team ventured into the Asia Math & Engineering Competition 2015 with trepidation due to their own prejudices about girls and engineering. They came in second.  That made them hungry for more success.  Said Jia Min: ""We exceeded our own expectations and our competitors' expectations of us.""  The school went on to set up a robotics enrichment group this year. ""Because of the success at the competition, they were spurred to do even more,"" said the school's vice-principal, Ms Cheong May Lan, 57.  ""They were so motivated after seeing that there was nothing to stop girls from doing robotics.""  PLMGS, which first opened its doors a century ago in 1916, started out as a school for boys. The school started admitting girls a year later. In 1961, it became an all-girls school.  The school was invited to participate in the competition in Indonesia after doing well in the Singapore leg where it won first and second places in the search-and-rescue category, ahead of Woodlands Ring Secondary School.  With two months leading up to the World Robot Games, the team would meet once a week to plan. ""We had to start from scratch,"" said Mr Indra, 41, who joined the school in 2013. ""I had to break the lessons down to the basics.""  Competitors were given problems that had to be solved using robots. After weeks of brainstorming and trial and error, the team created three types of robots for the disaster recovery theme of the competition.  They created a search-and-rescue robot which could use a gripper to retrieve objects and pull and push things, a ""sumo"" robot that could simulate the pushing of big boulders and a robot that could follow floor maps to reach people that may be trapped or captured.  The competition in Indonesia, which saw 327 participants from five Asian countries, was not without hiccups.  ""When we arrived, we saw that the competition track had slopes. We were not prepared for that,"" said Mr Indra. The girls stayed up late into the night trying to reconfigure their robots.  PLMGS was Singapore's only representative. ""Students from other countries were also madly configuring their robots, plugging them in and out to test them. It was quite intimidating,"" said Lee Wen.  ""When it was our turn to send out our robots, everyone was staring at us. We were the outsiders,"" said Sec 2 student Christina Tan, 14.  But they made sure that did not faze them.  In addition to three gold awards, two silvers and two bronzes, they won eight performance awards, plus a spirit award for showmanship and perseverance.  ""It felt good to beat the boys, who people think are supposed to dominate robotics,"" said Ling Yin.  PLMGS has plans to venture deeper into the robotics arena, looking at future collaborations with tertiary institutions in the research field. Its robotics interest group has 35 students now. ""The sky is the limit for these girls,"" said Mr Indra.

39,"Much like how personal computers transformed the way people saw and used technology, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Programme Office Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said the personal, general-purpose robots would revolutionise the way such technologies feature in people's lives.  SINGAPORE: Much like how personal computers transformed the way people saw and used technology, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Programme Office Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said the personal, general-purpose robots would revolutionise the way such technologies feature in people's lives.    He was speaking on Friday (Feb 10), at the opening panel discussion of this years Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Hacking Medicine  a weekend-long hackathon aimed at finding solutions to improve healthcare and eldercare through the use of personal robotics.    ""This revolution of the personal general-purpose robot - capable of sensing, processing and doing things, would be even bigger than the revolution that was brought about in the last 30 years by the personal computer, said Dr Balakrishnan, to an audience of around 160 participants including engineers, clinicians, designers, developers, researchers and business people.    We want Singapore to be one of these nodes where new ideas, crazy ideas, will change the world. Will liberate human beings from the burdens of age. Will help us remain masters of our lives and still retain our humanity, still retain our connections with other human beings and make life better.    Participants will develop software and hardware applications on Loomo  a Segway robotic platform, in focus areas of mental health, rehabilitation and recovery, community care or long-term care. These would allow the robots to become robot assistants capable of understanding and engaging with elderly, as well as patients with conditions such as Alzheimer's and others. Participants may also define a suitable challenge statement based around the theme of Social Robotics for Eldercare.    Dr Balakrishnan reminded participants that such solutions had to address real human needs and remain safer than existing technology or treatments. They also had to be more cost effective and financially accessible to all, while remaining acceptable and resonate with human beings on a psychological and emotional level.    When youre dealing with physical devices capable of sensing and responding in a very sophisticated way, that whole usability and human-robot interface is going to be a very rich field for research and development, said Dr Balakrishnan.    Winners of the hackathon will be announced on Sunday, with a top prize of US$5,000. Their projects will also be featured on a panel at EmTech Asia on Feb 15, while selected teams will be supported by agencies such as government-owned private innovation entity SGInnovate to further refine and scale-up solutions.    At the end of that well put some money behind those with real potential, because wed also like to build not only for Singapore, but for other countries as well, said SGInnovates Founding CEO Steve Leonard.    Healthcare is a really big challenge for us. And we think about providing care for people in that age  they need more help physically, they need more help mentally, and thats why we think this robotics platform allows us to find new ways to provide that care.

40,"SGInnovate will focus on areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, digital health, financial services, smart energy, digital manufacturing and transportation.  AsianScientist (Nov. 23, 2016) - SGInnovate, Singapores concerted effort to take deep technology to the world, was launched on Tuesday to great fanfare.  The crowd of researchers, innovators, venture capitalists and industry mentors was treated to a dramatic opening video sequence at 32 Carpenter Street, a six-storey building in town that will be SGInnovates official headquarters.  In attendance was guest-of-honor Mr. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapores Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies, Ms. Yong Ying-I, Chairman of SGInnovate, and Mr. Steve Leonard, Founding CEO of SGInnovate.  Wholly owned by the Singapore government, SGInnovate will connect tech entrepreneurs with industry mentors and venture capitalists, and provide support for business plan development, sources of funding, and go-to-market efforts.  Tharman encouraged budding entrepreneurs in the room to create deep technology that had global applications.  SGInnovate, which was announced earlier this year as part of the Budget 2016, falls under the National Research Foundation of Singapore. It was formerly known as Infocomm Investments Pte Ltd, the venture investment arm of the former Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore.  Here at 32CS, which is short for 32 Carpenter Street, engineers and research scientists from the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, McLaren Applied Technologies, NVIDIA and Ethereum will work side-by-side with researchers from varsity partners National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Institute of Technology and Singapore University of Technology and Design.  The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore, which is represented at SGInnovate by its subsidiary, IP Value Lab, will help founders protect their innovations and identify commercialization opportunities.  SGInnovate has also partnered UK-based Entrepreneur First to launch the inaugural Singapore EF program, a full-time, six-month-long program that began in September 2016. Nearly half of the 55-member cohort are PhD students and post-doctoral fellows from local universities.  Young entrepreneurs will also benefit from upcoming initiatives such as AI Evenings @ SGInnovate, which will be supported by partners such as NVIDIA and McLaren Applied Technologies, and MIT Hacking Medicine, which will be co-organized with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 10-12 February 2017.  Our basic premise at SGInnovate is simple: we believe that Singapore has all of the resources that it needs to build globally relevant products and globally relevant companies, Leonard said at the launch.

41,"Traditionally, robots sit in the factory within a finite space and with fixed rules, a safe distance away from its human operators. Today, the capabilities of robots have grown and humans and robots can almost work hand in hand. This may have resulted in the fear of robots for taking over jobs or the loss of the ""human touch"".  Against the backdrop of the tightening labour market and rising manpower costs, adopting robotic technology could potentially boost productivity, in addition to strengthening competitiveness and generating growth, whilst retaining staff employment. Studies have shown that robotics and automation have made a positive net effect on labour demand in the Europe and United States regions1.  Robotics has been identified as a growth sector in the international marketplace. Having a headstart in building competitive and differentiated robotics ecosystem may prove to be beneficial. According to the International Federation of Robotics Statistical Analysis and EU Roadmap 2013, the global robotics industry is projected to grow from US$20b today to US$80b by 2025.  China, already the global leader in the robotics sales market, will continue their quest at adopting robotics, targetting to achieve a robot density of 150 units by 2020. The Republic of Korea and Japan are hot on the heels of China2. Japan, already a known robotics powerhouse, has plans to triple its spending on intelligent machines to 2.4t yen by 20203. Robotics is also one of the pillars of Singapores future economy, with strong government support in the form of the National Robotics Programme.  The path to adopting robotics  starting with cobotisation   The path to adopting robotics has to be a well-planned one, and a good starting point would be to redesign work spaces to allow for an inclusive workplace where humans and robots can work together in a collaborative and mutually reinforcing way  cobotisation.  It is possible for a degree of artificial intelligence, perhaps a form of ambient intelligence, in robotic technologies to create effective engagements between man and machine. With the current advancements in sensor technology, visual analytics, and machine learning, robots are emerging as a viable working mate in both traditional settings and for new applications across industries.  At Tung Lok Group, it takes only two chefs to operate a cooking robot that can prepare up to 60kg of food. Smarter robotic arms are being developed to ensure safety and to minimise errors and wastage, monitored by technically-savvy human controllers. Small business owners such as toys and jewellery makers can also save time by automating some of their processes with automated 3D printers. The possibilities of robotics assisting humans are endless.  Getting ready for the change   Like any form of transformation, stakeholders would have to understand the business' stance and embrace the shift towards cobotisation. Business owners, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), must take the first step in understanding how robotics technologies can help their business stay competitive and look into the potential funding opportunities to ease them into the path of robotic technology adoption.  Small businesses can also participate in incubator programmes or training workshops established by industry leaders. ABB's Regional Robotics Packaging Application Hub features demo units to allow customers, partners, and ABB to run trials with actual products, assemble robotics systems, and run tests. Such innovation platforms benefit the emerging companies and are good best practices that could be adopted to fit their needs.  Before taking the plunge into the drive for robotics and automation, employers should start redesigning jobs and equip employees with new skills to prepare them for the shift towards cobotisation. They could also tap on funding and re-skilling opportunities available through the government or industry associations. In Singapore, we have the National Robotics Programme, which pledged $450m to help companies apply robotics and automation solutions.  Industry support is key   The transformation of the business should also be supported by the government agencies and industry associations.  Organisations such as SPRING Singapore has already taken steps to encourage more enterprises to adopt digital and automation solutions with its recently launched industry-specific roadmap. By partnering the Workforce Singapore to re-skill labour, the agencies will ensure a holistic transition, starting with the food services and retail industry.  The success of the first VendCaf, a food vending machine, is a prime example of the possibility of shifting towards robotics and automation. It not only requires 70% to 90% less manpower, but is also available 24/7 to consumers. There are already plans to launch more of such machines around the country.  1Study of Mannheim Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) and the University of Utrecht, 2016; and World Robotics Report 2016.

42,"More than most developed nations, Singapore has reached a point where one of the biggest growth drivers will be through increased productivity. With an ageing population and limited space, it cannot count on large-scale manufacturing to employ thousands of people, or embark on major infrastructure works to provide an economic boost.  With global growth continuing to be weak, rising protectionism and weak investment demand and trade demand, it needs other ways to grow this export-orientated economy. The answer could come from both education, and Robotics Process Automation (RPA).  Singapore, arguably, already has one of the most educated workforces in the world. Singaporean students often top world rankings for subjects such as maths, science, and reading, and its world-class schools and universities are increasingly attracting students from developed nations. Furthermore, Singaporean parents prioritise their childrens higher education above everything else, including their own retirement, spending an average of $21,000 (US$15,623) per year on university fees (more than twice the global average)1.  Yet, despite best efforts, productivity growth over the past three years has remained flat, according to government figures2. One of the reasons behind this is the fact that many an educated Singaporean worker is in a job that they are overqualified for. In finance, for example, it is not uncommon for fresh graduates to spend the first few years of their careers conducting repetitive, rules-based tasks  checking mortgage applications, copy-pasting data, moving files and documents.  There are various reasons behind this, the main one being the out-dated, old legacy IT systems that many banks still use that are unable to automate such simple tasks  hence the need for humans. The end result is a highly educated young graduate spending hours a day doing mundane, boring tasks that they did not spend four years at university (not to mention $21,000) to do.  This is where RPA comes in. RPA is software that mimics human interaction on a computer, essentially allowing companies to automate many of the repetitive, rules-based tasks currently carried out by thousands of white-collar workers. RPA has very low risk (no underlying code is changed), it is cheap, and efficiency and cost savings are almost immediate.  Robotics Process Automation is directly related to productivity. If you can automate a task, allowing you to complete that activity in half the time, then you have already improved productivity significantly. The resulting efficiencies and cost savings can then allow the company to expand, it will allow it to become more competitive especially against lower cost foreign rivals, and it will be able to meet demand  directly benefitting the consumer.  Whilst the jobs of those workers who have been replaced may be lost, more will be directly created but in other areas, such as sales, business development, or client servicing depending on the industry. Indirectly  and this is especially true for industries with large volumes of transactions such as finance, insurance, utilities, and telecoms  lower costs for consumers allow them to save money and spend elsewhere, providing a secondary boost for the economy.  In most cases, though, those workers replaced by RPA will simply be able to do what they spent years studying at university for. So instead of bean counting, young accountants will be free to learn how to analyse data and provide a broader, more valuable service for their clients. HR personnel will be able to process more applicants in a shorter amount of time, allowing them to concentrate on really finding the right person for the job. The list is endless, but the benefits are the same: less repetitive, unskilled work freeing workers up to do more valuable, higher-skilled activities.  In 2017, Singapore will need to articulate a new growth mission, and this needs to come from increased productivity, leading to sustainable growth. Armed with an already well-educated workforce, the city-state is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the incredible increases in productivity that Robotics Process Automation brings.  1HSBC, Value of Education: Foundations for the future survey   2Singapore Budget, Transforming our Economy through Enterprise and Innovation.

43,"Singapore headquarted venture capital firm Monks Hill has made an undisclosed funding into California-based robotics company OhmniLabs, marking its first financing in a Vietnam-connected company.  Monks Hill and OhmniLabs confirmed the deal with this portal, but did not reveal any financial details.  Vu Duy Thuc, the Vietnamese co-founder and CEO of OhmniLabs, said Monks Hill investment was part of the companys seed fundraising round. The proceeds will be used to grow our engineering team, he said in an email interaction.  A lot of international companies have extolled the virtues of Vietnamese tech talents and actually hired local engineers for their global operations. Thuc hopes to build out a tech team based in the country in the near future.  In conjunction with the financing by Monks Hill, the robotics startup launched its home robot, Ohmni, on April 12 through a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.  During the crowdfunding campaign, the robot will be available for an introductory price of $1,399. This price is $500 off the MSRP (manufacturers suggested retail price).  Ohmni offers a better alternative than conventional video chat for a more natural and engaging interaction. The product is designed specifically for homes and families, with a pilot period targeting the elders.  Families today are often spread out across countries and continents, making it a challenge to stay in touch. We created a robot that people can use everyday to not only communicate but experience life together. The possibilities are endless. I use Ohmni with my grandma in Vietnam and its amazing how natural our interaction is, said Thuc.  The robot works through the connection with the Internet and can be operated remotely. The tele-presence platform, built on a cloud programming API known as OhmniAPI, can move around the house to help people enjoy the shared experiences instead of sitting in front of the screen. Itcan also be integrated with Amazon Alexa API.  Ohmnis elder-friendly features has proven helpful for these families and their feedback has been positive.  Were honored to be a part of this funding round for OhmniLabs. The team is fantastic and we love that theyre obsessive in their pursuit of building robots that improve everyday lives. Its a huge mission, but theyre well on their way, commented Justin Nguyen, operating advisor at Monks Hill Ventures.  OhmniLabs was founded in 2015. Thuc, with a PhD degree from Stanford University in computer science, exited his two previous ventures, Katango and Tappy, to Google and Weeby.co. He has been involved in many community projects, one of which is VietSeeds, a nonprofit organisation to empower underprivileged students in Vietnam. He also invests in early stage startups and helps grow the ecosystem in Vietnam.  The other two co-founders, Tingxi Tan and Jared Go, also have extensive experience in AI, machine learning, multi-agent systems, industrial design, mechanical & electrical engineering and cloud infrastructure.

45,"Standing at just 1.4m, Hospi, Changi General Hospital's (CGH) newest porter, still gets the occasional stare as it moves along the building's corridors.  That is because it is not human. It has a computer screen for a face, and a cold, hard, white body to match.  But it can move almost as well as a person, with the ability to avoid obstacles, take the lift and move from room to room to deliver items without supervision, and has, since last year, taken on some of the work of porters at the hospital.  CGH is not alone in turning to intelligent mechanical helpers. Over at the National University Hospital, a robotic system automatically picks up and packs medicine at its pharmacy, even keeping track of expiry dates.  Healthcare is a notoriously labour-intensive affair, where ferrying a single bed-bound patient to get an X-ray requires the combined effort of two hospital staff. Each day hundreds of trips are also taken on foot to deliver medicine, medical samples and reports across hospital floors.  It is against this backdrop that doctors and scientists alike started dreaming up ideas of robotic employees some 10 years ago - visions that are starting to take shape today.  These intelligent machines are only going to get closer to patients, eventually even helping to lift them off their beds, says Nanyang Technological University (NTU) don Ang Wei Tech.     Above: Microbiological testing laboratory Ugene Laboratory Services invested in a $1.5 million robot to do routine tasks like weighing samples and to conduct simple tests for bacteria like E. coli. PHOTOS: LIM SIN THAI, MARCUS TAN, AZIZ HUSSIN FOR THE STRAITS TIMES     Associate Professor Ang, who is associate chair of research at the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, said such a robot is still a few years away, but he has his sights set on creating one that can move three patients on their hospital beds at once, with just one person to supervise it.  The university is one of many academic institutions, companies and start-ups worldwide that are trying to gain a foothold in the multibillion-dollar robotics industry. And healthcare is just one sector that robotics has infiltrated.  The industry is exploding and disrupting life as we know it.  CHEAPER AND SMARTER    Robots first made their mark in the manufacturing industry in the 1970s, taking on mundane and repetitive tasks such as assembling different machine parts - all done in the confines of cages built specially for them in factories.     Above: A robotic arm in NUH automatically picking up and packing medicine at the pharmacy. The machine is part of the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation System that went live in November 2014. . PHOTOS: LIM SIN THAI, MARCUS TAN, AZIZ HUSSIN FOR THE STRAITS TIMES     But in recent years they have morphed into the collaborative robots or ""co-bots"" that work alongside humans, equipped with better sensing capabilities for safety and higher levels of artificial intelligence, and now have ventured out of their cages and factories.  Experts attribute this to advancements in mobile computing technology that have driven down the cost of micro-controllers - essentially computers on a chip that give robots their artificial intelligence - from $10,000 a decade ago to about $200 today.  The cost of force control sensors that tell the robot to stop when it makes contact with an obstacle - for example, a human arm - has also fallen from over $10,000 to around $1,000 over the same period, said Prof Ang.     Above: A CGH nurse collecting documents delivered by Hospi, which takes on the work of porters. .PHOTOS: LIM SIN THAI, MARCUS TAN, AZIZ HUSSIN FOR THE STRAITS TIMES     Hence it is now possible for a typical robot with six axes - meaning it can move six different ways - to have a micro-controller and a force sensor at each joint. This makes it far more sensitive to human touch and, hence, safer.  These days robots cut across various sectors, including healthcare, transport, security, logistics and manufacturing - creating an industry that is taking shape as the centrepiece of the next industrial revolution.  The global robotics industry is expected to grow from US$20 billion (S$27 billion) to US$80 billion by 2025, according to the International Federation Report on Robotics Statistical Analysis and EU Roadmap 2013.  Last year, over 240,000 industrial robots were sold - a 12 per cent increase from the year before, with China leading the pack with 68,000 units sold in the country. The International Federation of Robotics has predicted that some 2.3 million units will be deployed on factory floors by 2018 - more than twice as many as in 2009.  But some human workers have paid a high price for the growth of robots. For example, Chinese company Foxconn Technology Group, which supplies electronics to Apple and Samsung, replaced 60,000 employees in its factories with robots.  Research agency Gartner predicts that by 2018 more than three million workers globally will be supervised by ""robobosses"" with the ability to evaluate an employee's performance solely on quantifiable data, such as the angle at which a waiter presents a plate or how quickly he smiles, and without bias. It adds that half of the fastest-growing firms will have fewer employees than smart machines.  However, job losses are much less of a problem for a country like Singapore, where manpower is in short supply, experts said. Dr Satish Lele, senior vice-president of automation and electronics at research agency Frost and Sullivan, Asia-Pacific, said questions about jobs being replaced are usually asked in developing countries that have an abundance of labour, but ""here, robots could be integral in creating the right balance between Singaporeans and foreign labour"".  The Economic Development Board (EDB) said robotics technology could be a way for the city-state - faced with an ageing population, slow population growth and political pressure to limit the inflow of foreign workers - to ""boost productivity amid a tight labour market"".  Besides enabling the continued employment of an ageing workforce through automation of production tasks, robotics allows manufacturing to be done at higher precision, quality, speed and consistency. It also enables tasks to be carried out in areas that are inaccessible to human workers, such as high-temperature and high-pressure environments, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  While industrial robots still make up the bulk of all robots deployed worldwide, experts said service robots are likely to be a greater force here. They expect to see many more service robots in the next five years, especially in the healthcare, food and beverage, and hospitality sectors, where labour is hardest to come by.  More robots will take on logistics tasks at hospitals, like the ones at CGH. Others will become waiters, like the robots Lucy and Mary at Rong Heng Seafood restaurant at the East Coast Seafood Centre. They can deliver food to any of the 29 tables on the ground floor of the restaurant in two minutes.  Four-year-old robotics start-up Techmetics has also invented a robot named Techi that can do the job of three hotel staff.  Two have been deployed at Park Avenue Rochester Hotel in Buona Vista, and have taken on the role of housekeeping aides, delivering bottled water, linen and toiletries to hotel rooms. They will be used later to deliver food, luggage and mail to guests' rooms.  Techmetics chief executive Mathan Muthupillai said four more such robots will make their debut at Singapore restaurants, including IndoChine and Kinsa Sushi, in two months, helping to serve food to patrons and clear their dishes.  Without the need for lunch, tea or dinner breaks, and with no ability to fall sick or become tired, robots can be at any employer's beck and call 24/7, said Mr Mathan.  PLAYING CATCH-UP    Right now, Singapore has some catching up to do with other countries because it started to adopt robots rather ""late in the game"", said Professor Tan Sze Wee, who is the executive director of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's Science and Engineering Research Council.  One reason for this, he said, was that ""until recently, manufacturing has largely been driven by labour growth rather than productivity growth, due to having a much younger workforce"".  Prof Ang, agreeing with Prof Tan, said Singapore was too cautious when robotics started to take off back in 2011, when the components needed to build them became cheaper. He and his colleagues approached the Government with proposals for robotics research and funds needed for it, but were turned down.  But in 2014, the Government turned to the NTU team instead for input on a national robotics programme. The same year, Google acquired eight robotics companies.  Still, Prof Ang said he believes that while Singapore lagged behind in adopting robot technology, the Republic is, in fact, on a par with other countries when it comes to robotics innovation.  ""The lack of funding over the last five years made it difficult for robotics technologies developed here to leave the laboratory and move into the market,"" he said. But he added that the tide can turn with the generous funding that the Government is now promising.  To catch up and even jump ahead, the Government announced a $450 million National Robotics Programme during the Budget debate in April this year, to drive the development, test-bedding and deployment of robotics technology in both public and private sectors.  An additional $400 million will also be made available to local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are keen to automate.  The EDB now sees huge potential in this field. ""Given the global growth potential of new-generation collaborative and service robots, with the right strategy, we see opportunities to nurture robotics into potentially a billion-dollar industry in the next five to 10 years,"" an EDB spokesman said.  That could in turn provide between 2,000 and 3,000 good job opportunities for engineers here, she added.  The Government has set its sights on these sectors: healthcare, transport, security, environment, logistics and manufacturing.  The strategy is to spur innovation in the public and private sectors while concurrently encouraging and supporting the adoption of market- ready robotics technology across manufacturing and services sectors among large, medium-sized and small businesses alike, the EDB said.  Singapore is not without success stories. Semiconductor maker Globalfoundries Singapore, for example, introduced intelligent systems to its factories in 2010 and now has 42 autonomous mobile robots to move materials in its manufacturing line. That has improved labour productivity by 25 per cent.  Researchers at NTU last year unveiled Nadine, a humanoid robot that can answer questions posed to it, remember past conversations and even gauge how a person is feeling by reading facial gestures.  Mr Charlie Ill, investment director at venture capital firm Red Dot Ventures, said the number of robotics start-ups that have come knocking on his door has gone up from just one last year to seven so far this year. The challenge for these start-ups, said Mr Ill, would be to differentiate themselves from the competition, in terms of cost and by providing a suite of software solutions that allows the robot to work independently with minimal human interaction.  ROBOTICS SAVVY    In the future, robots will greet customers at retail stores and give suggestions based on past purchases. They will front restaurants, take orders as patrons queue and help cut waiting times.  In healthcare, they will improve treatment precision in surgery, for example. At home, they will help caregivers and support independent living with assistive technology, said CGH chief executive Lee Chien Earn.  They will also help reshape experiences and business processes. They will create jobs that never existed, and change the concept of what types of jobs are suitable for humans.  ""Through strategic deployment"", the EDB said, ""advanced robotics can potentially help free up resources, enabling our workforce to take on higher-value, more productive jobs"".  Robotics manpower talent will be required at all levels, it added, from operators who can program and work comfortably with robots to engineers and scientists who can design and build the next generation of robots, as well as those who can contribute to research and development.  Also needed are cyber-security teams that can prevent robots from getting hacked, said market analyst Bob Gill from ARC Advisory Group.  To ensure robotics really takes flight here, more thought has to be put into how to retrain workers for new jobs, and to create a new generation of workers who are not just tech-savvy but ""robotics-savvy"", said Prof Tan. ""We need to think about how we train them at schools, at universities, and to get kids interested in robots,"" he added.  As a start, IDA has launched the Robotics and Maker Academy to teach primary and secondary school students to code and program robots. Since 2014, more than 10,000 students have gone through the programme.  The agency also launched the Code@SG movement in 2014, which includes the National Infocomm Competition that allows students to pit their skills in areas like robotics, security, data analytics and coding.  An Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore spokesman said the aim is for young Singaporeans to become confident with coding and robotics technology to help prepare them for a Smart Nation future.  At the end of the day, acceptance is key, said Prof Tan.

46,"Local start-up AiTreat says the Singapore basketball team is one of the beneficiaries of its Expert Manipulative Massage Automation (EMMA) robot.  SINGAPORE: A robot capable of giving targeted physiotherapy massages to relieve muscle strains and injuries has been developed by local start-up AiTreat, and was previewed on Monday (Jul 18).    The Expert Manipulative Massage Automation (EMMA) was created by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) graduate and AiTreat CEO Albert Zhang.  Mr Zhang, a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) physician of five years, said: ""TCM is competing with other industries for physically fit people who can learn TCM knowledge. It's pretty difficult. The salaries keep increasing. The clinics are not earning a lot of profit, even though the charge is not low any longer.  ""So we hope, other than the solving the labour shortage, the robot can also bring scientific data. So, TCM (practitioners) can do research, can have scientific support to show to their patients what their condition is, what their improvement is, and what should be done in the future.  ""We have designed EMMA as a clinically precise tool that can automatically carry out treatment for patients as prescribed by a physiotherapist or Chinese physician,"" he added.  Our aim is not to replace the therapists who are skilled in sports massage and acupoint therapy, but to improve productivity by enabling one therapist to treat multiple patients with the help of our robots.""  Physicians will continue to consult patients and perform physical check-ups - assessing what massages and methods are best - while leaving EMMA to the heavy-duty work.    ""Basically, you build a work flow to tell the robot what to do. Then the robot will do the hard and tedious, time-consuming work,"" said Mr Zhang. ""After that, the physician can do the manipulations and the acupuncture. If the physician has a lot of patients; if he's very popular, he can have an assistant to help them operate several robots at the same time, to serve more people and charge a lower price.""    According to Mr Zhang, EMMA is probably the first such robot in the world developed specifically for use by TCM physicians and sports therapists.  EMMA has already been used to treat Singapore's national basketball team using acupoint therapy.  ""There are different levels that the robot masseuse can do, so I think it will target the different needs, especially with team sports, like basketball, where it needs to cater to more than one athlete - all 12 of us,"" said national basketballer Leon Kwek. ""So I think if we had a masseuse for one team, then he would be tired out by the time he reaches the seventh or eighth athlete. I think it helps reduce his workload, at the same time giving - in a way - equal treatment to every single one of us.""  The robot comprises a single robotic arm, capable of highly articulated movements, and also has a 3D-stereoscopic camera for vision, and a customised, fully rotatable 3D-printed massage tip.  To ensure consistent quality of therapy, EMMA is equipped with sensors and diagnostic functions that will measure a patient's progress, as well as exact stiffness of a particular muscle or tendon. These are uploaded to the AiTreats propriety cloud-based intelligence platform for analysis.  The robot has undergone trials at TCM clinic Kin Teck Tong since last week, where it has treated 50 patients.  Said Ms Coco Zhang, Executive Director of Kin Teck Tong: Like many developed countries, Singapore has the problem of an ageing population. Over the next decade, more people are going to suffer from physical ailments such as arthritis and will be seeking treatment.  In our trials with the robot, the experience has been very good, as it can perform most treatments as well as our therapists, she added.  Moving forward, AiTreat will focus on developing its second-generation robot, which is more compact and mobile, the start-up said. The team is also looking into using heated contact pads to better simulate human hands.",2016-07-17,Local start-up AiTreat says the Singapore basketball team is one of the beneficiaries of its Expert Manipulative Massage Automation (EMMA) ...,Robot 'therapist' to improve productivity among TCM physicians,http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/robot-therapist-to/2965280.html
47,"Cloud computing has the potential to revolutionize the field of robotics, but there are key considerations to look into before you leap.  AsianScientist (Oct. 29, 2016) - By Oliver Tian - According to the International Federation of Robotics Statistical Analysis, the global robotics industry is projected to grow from US$20 billion today to US$80 billion by 2025.  China, already the global leader in the robotics sales market, is targeting to achieve a robot density of 150 industrial robots per 10,000 workers by 2020. Not to be outdone, Japan has plans to triple its spending on intelligent machines to 2.4 trillion yen by 2020.  Against the backdrop of a tightening labor market and rising manpower costs, adopting robotic technology could boost productivity while strengthening competitiveness and generating growth at the same time, thus helping to retain staff. Robotics is also one of the pillars of Singapores future economy, with strong government support in the form of the National Robotics Program.      Robotics on the cloud  But when planning to deploy robotic applications, we need to think about how each application can be quickly assimilated into our existing work systems, and at what scale. The best way to do this is to choose technology and business partners that have flexibility and scalability built into their offerings, so that when the time comes, you can seamlessly expand into new markets as necessary.  One key consideration for enabling robotic systems is cloud computing. Like the human brain, the cloud receives signals from sensors and actuators which are analogous to the limbs of the body. In turn, the limb nodes receive instructions from the brain to take action.  Like reflex nerves, however, some robotic touch points may have embedded logic to respond instantaneously, bypassing the cloud. Such local processing is a reflexive action rather than an analytical response to a trigger or change in status. Some degree of short-term memory and local processing power can be located in the robot itself for these unthinking reactions, but context and long-term memory are ultimately provided by the cloud. Such a design provides continued functionality in the event of temporary disconnection with the cloud.  Advanced artificial intelligence needs massive back-end computing power and memory management to support the decision making needed for robotic perception. The more powerful the robot (in terms of decision making and processing), the more powerful the back office will need to be. In other words, increasing robotic sophistication increases the potential to offload compute-intensive tasks like image processing, voice recognition, data comparison and analytics with high latency decision making, to the cloud.      The challenge of communication  Whilst the processing capability of the cloud is important, what makes robot applications unique is the potential of the cloud to both mess-up and make sense of the robots context based on the huge volume of data collected. Upon smart filtering and analysis, this tacit intelligence can complement other continuous inputs coming from the robots own sensors. Furthermore, centralized processing will also enable multiple robots to be made aware of information, resulting in extended synchronization.  Sometimes referred to as the hive mind, this architecture will not only be able to process disparate data, but also be able to store huge amounts of information, securely and in an organized way. As such, certain key robotic functions could be made available as a service on-demand. These on-demand robotic functions will drive more and more advanced robotic processing capability.  Just as humans try to work together in teams, robots generally also need figure out how to operate in tandem. Questions that arise include how robots will communicate with the brain in the first place, and how they will then translate that intelligence to other robots and their human counterparts. This communication will require some kind of mediator. However, not all companies seeking to implement robotics solutions have a firm understanding of these underlying challenges.  Today, businesses in every industry around the world are demonstrating that robotics is more than just hype. Your company could be the next to unlock new profitable business models, foster innovation and create amazing new experiences for your customersas long as you approach robotic applications with an open mind and a clear understanding of its potential for your business!  All these and more will be discussed at the upcoming inaugural edition of the Singapore International Robo Expo, a conference and exhibition co-organised by the Singapore Industrial Automation Association (SIAA) and Experia Events. The event will be held from November 1-2, 2016, at the Marina Bay Sands Convention and Exhibition Centre in Singapore.     Mr Oliver Tian is the president of SIAA and the CEO and director of HutCabb Services. SIAA drives Automation, IoT, and Robotics (AIR), with robotics as one of the key pillars in our charter. The association has embarked on this robotic journey to bring automation to a different level and we believe the assimilation of man and machine functions can be a potent force to be reckoned with.

Thousands of scientists and people from other walks of life turned out in Washington and New York on Saturday for Earth Day events that organizers have framed as a ""celebration"" of science to counter a growing disregard for evidence-based knowledge.  WASHINGTON:Thousands of scientists and people from other walks of life turned out in Washington and New York on Saturday for Earth Day events that organizers have framed as a ""celebration"" of science to counter a growing disregard for evidence-based knowledge.  The ""March for Science"" festivities included ""teach-ins"" on the National Mall and parades in midtown Manhattan and hundreds of other cities and towns. The events were non-partisan, according to organizers, aimed at reaffirming ""the vital role science plays in our democracy,"" according to the march's website.  Still, the marches were effectively protests against steep cuts that President Donald Trump has proposed for federal science and research budgets and his administration's skepticism about climate change and the need to slow global warming.  ""It's important to show this administration that we care about facts,"" said Chris Taylor, 24, who was part of an early crowd of about 15,000 who gathered on the Mall for teach-ins on topics like climate change, water quality and sustainable food. The event finished with a march from the Washington Monument to Union Square.  ""It just seems like they're not really concerned about economic growth or creating new technologies, just catering to massive corporations,"" said Taylor, who is earning a PhD in robotics at George Mason University in Virginia.  March for Science is the latest in a series of national demonstrations staged since Trump's inauguration nearly 100 days ago. Previous marches and protests have focused on a range of partisan issues, from abortion rights to immigration policy.  The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday's marches but Trump released a statement promoting his administration's steps to guard against pollution while minimizing limits on industry.  ""My administration is reducing unnecessary burdens on American workers and American companies, while being mindful that our actions must also protect the environment,"" Trump said in a statement.  ""Rigorous science is critical to my Administration's efforts to achieve the twin goals of economic growth and environmental protection,"" he said.  In the past, Trump has said climate change was a hoax that was stifling policies to foster economic growth.  His administration is considering withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, a global accord aimed at reducing global emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Last year the United States, under President Barack Obama, joined more than 190 other countries in signing the pact.  Trump's proposed 2018 budget calls for deep spending cuts by government science agencies, including a 31 percent reduction for the Environmental Protection Agency.  March organizers are also worried by what they see as growing skepticism from politicians and others on topics such as vaccinations, genetically modified organisms and evolution.  The scientific community's direct involvement in a national policy debate has stirred some criticism about whether scientists should get involved in politics. But organizers have defended the march as crucial because of the threat posed by discrediting scientific consensus and restricting research.  ""As scientists, as human beings, our mandate is clear - it's to stand up for what we know to be true,"" said Kellan Baker, a senior fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and one of the speakers on the National Mall.  That theme was echoed by many who showed up in Washington for teach-ins, which organizers said were a centerpiece of the initial Earth Day held in 1970 to call attention to the environment.  ""Science isn't respected and it needs to be,"" said Sarah Binkow, 22, a civil engineer who traveled from Pontiac, Michigan, to attend the Washington rally.  ""Being here definitely gives me hope that there's this overwhelming population that supports science and supports scientific theory,"" she said.  The speakers in Washington included Bill Nye, an educator and television personality known as ""the Science Guy,"" and Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician and public health advocate who first called attention to the high levels of lead in the drinking water of Flint, Michigan.

49,"76-year-old Mr Tan is at the doctors for his backache. While he waits for his appointment, a robot trundles up and asks for his symptoms. Later, the doctor prescribes a mobile app with exercises.  This could well be the future of healthcare in Singapore. Its national health robotics lab  Centre for Healthcare Assistive and Robotics Technology at Changi General Hospital  is researching and testing new ways to deliver care and improve staffs productivity.  GovInsider spoke with Selina Seah, the centres director and Assistant Chief Executive of Changi General Hospital, to find out what lies ahead.      Smart hospitals  Singapores ageing population is leading to more complex diseases, people living longer and fewer caregivers  what Seah calls a triple tsunami. The government plans to build smart hospitals to deal with this onslaught using robotics.  Changi General Hospital has started by automating logistics. Transport robots have been working in the hospital since last year, moving documents, drugs, specimens and linen. They navigate obstacles on their own, and are linked with the hospitals fire alarm system for emergencies. The hospital next plans to use robots to move heavier objects, like patient beds.  It is also researching roles for robots to interact directly with people. We are looking at robots to be the interface between humans, she says. For instance, robots could get information from patients while they wait to see a doctor.  A third area for robots is in precision medicine. The hospital is researching whether robots can be used for surgeries and rehabilitation. They can help in making sure that the treatment is consistent and precise, far more than a human, says Seah. Robots would be able to pinpoint the exact location of tumours, for instance, and do less damage doing surgeries.  The hospital is researching whether mobile apps can be used for treatments. We are look at working with certain researchers and also industry players, she says.  Chronic diseases are on the rise, and their treatment involves lifestyle changes. For instance, drugs only do half the work for diabetes, Seah says. Patients must also exercise and watch their diet. How do we prescribe that part and ensure that can be complied to  Mobile apps can help by gamifying healthcare, she says. Apps can track their performance and use the data to motivate patients to change their behaviour. People challenge themselves if there is a goal to be challenged on, Seah says.  Singapore is not the only one looking at health apps. The US Food and Drug Administration is looking at certified mobile health apps, Seah says, while South Korea and European countries are fighting to enter.  Such apps are yet to be clinically trialled, however. They must be tested to ensure that patients recover faster. Its no different from the rigour one needs to go through for drugs, she says.  Even with new treatments, every person reacts uniquely to exercise, drugs and food. Doctors have to try various combinations to find out what works best for each patient. When the trials dont work and diseases get more complicated, it becomes a huge burden to the whole society. This is the problem here for us in Singapore, she says.  Singapore is looking at how it can use personalised treatments to prevent complications. Its a five-year research programme which has just started, Seah says, targeting diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular diseases.  The country has already taken the first step towards it. It has built a national electronic health records system. It is now looking to build predictive algorithms that can analyse data, like blood sugar readings, and recommend personalised treatments. This would be able to alert individuals and hospitals before people fall seriously ill.  The vision for smart hospitals could become a reality in three to five years, she says. A few things that will need to change to make way, however.  Robots will take over some jobs, people will need to be retrained. We foresee the need to transform the workforce in the next five to ten years, Seah says.  Security will have to be improved with the increased use of data analytics. Some mobile health technologies are still hackable, she says. Singapore will need to be a step ahead on cyber security issues.  A third challenge is coordination across government. There are many personal views about robotics, she says, and even more about health robots. Getting all the stakeholders to agree on funding priorities has been a rather long engagement. The health robotics lab plays a crucial role in bringing all the stakeholders on the same page.
