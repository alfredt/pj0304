0,0,"I suppose I could sit here and fret over a day in the not-too-distant future when a robot powered by artificial intelligence(AI) will spit out newspaper columns like this one, rendering redundant columnists like me. After all, there have been reports that computers can already churn out news reports that read almost as well as those written by journalists, and in a fraction of the time taken.  The thought of being replaced by software is depressing and, I might add, self-defeating.  That is why I disagree with the way technological advances and the future of work are all too often framed in either-or terms: either robot or human worker, either AI or human brain.  Here are a few recent examples of headlines in local media that fall into this category : ""AI may replace a third of graduate jobs: Study"", published on April 6; ""Evidence that robots are winning the race for American jobs"", published on March 30; and ""Robots may take over 10 million jobs in Britain in 15 years"", published on March 25.  Such reports reflect how automation and AI are more often than not viewed - not just in Singapore but in other parts of the world too - as threats to jobs and human well-being. An extreme example of such thinking is exemplified by historian Yuval Noah Harari, author of the best-selling book Sapiens: A Brief History Of Humankind.  In an essay for ideas.ted.com bearing the headline The Rise Of The Useless Class, he writes: ""The most important question in 21st-century economics may well be: What should we do with all the superfluous people, once we have highly intelligent non-conscious algorithms that can do almost everything better than humans""  He adds that ""the idea that humans will always have a unique ability beyond the reach of non-conscious algorithms is just wishful thinking"" because ""every animal - including Homo sapiens - is an assemblage of organic algorithms shaped by natural selection over millions of years of evolution"".  I question if human beings can be reduced to ""assemblages of organic algorithms"" but even if that view has some basis, it remains unclear what time frame Mr Harari has in mind for his doomsday scenario.  For the foreseeable future, though, I propose a reframing of the challenge, along the lines put forth in a 2015 Harvard Business Review (HBR) article by Professor Thomas H. Davenport and Ms Julia Kirby entitled Beyond Automation.  They write: ""What if we were to reframe the situation  ""What if, rather than asking the traditional question - what tasks currently performed by humans will soon be done more cheaply and rapidly by machines - we ask a new one: what new feats might people achieve if they had better thinking machines to assist them  ""Instead of seeing work as a zero-sum game with machines taking an ever greater share, we might see growing possibilities for employment.  ""We could reframe the threat of automation as an opportunity for augmentation.""  New feats, growing possibilities for employment, opportunity for augmentation - such phrases are not common currency in talk on the future of work. Yet they should be.  A change of focus from automation to augmentation changes the outlook for humans.  The first implies they will be replaced by robots while the second points to them collaborating with robots to achieve that which is impossible today.  Such a paradigm shift has the power to unlock human potential for it encourages people to stop agonising over cost and headcount cuts and imagine instead ways to bring about growth - business growth, economic growth, personal and professional growth.  I take heart that the man championing this paradigm shift from automation to augmentation - Prof Davenport - is considered an expert in information technology and management. A research fellow at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Centre for Digital Business, he penned the article with Ms Kirby, an HBR editor-at-large.  They also quote MIT economist David Autor, who closely tracks the effects of automation on labour markets and points to the immense challenge of applying machines to tasks that call for flexibility, judgment or common sense.  He says: ""Tasks that cannot be substituted by computerisation are generally complemented by it"", a point that ""is as fundamental as it is overlooked"".  So what to make of those dire forecasts of millions of jobs - including graduate jobs - being lost to robots and AI My sense is they are unhelpful. The impact of technology differs from place to place, depending on context and local circumstances. The rise of robots is much less of a concern for a small, labour-scarce country like Singapore than it is for a large, labour-rich one like China.  Worries about mass unemployment may in fact be overblown, the McKinsey Global Institute concludes in a report issued in January - A Future That Works: Automation, Employment And Productivity.  ""While much of the current debate about automation has focused on the potential for mass unemployment, predicated on a surplus of human labour, the world's economy will actually need every erg of human labour working, in addition to the robots, to overcome demographic ageing trends in both developed and developing economies.  ""In other words, a surplus of human labour is much less likely to occur than a deficit of human labour, unless automation is deployed widely,"" the McKinsey team writes.  Yes, the nature of work will change. As processes are transformed by automation of certain tasks, ""people will perform activities that are complementary to the work that machines do (and vice versa)"". The key word here is complementary, that is, humans and robots working together.  There will also be changes in how companies are organised, the bases of industry competition and business models. So yes, there will be disruption and humans will have to adapt. But the McKinsey report presents a more nuanced picture of what will happen to jobs by breaking them down into activities.  ""We consider work activities a more relevant and useful measure since occupations are made up of a range of activities with different potential for automation.  ""For example, a retail salesperson will spend some time interacting with customers, stocking shelves, or ringing up sales. Each of these activities is distinct and requires different capabilities to perform successfully,"" the McKinsey team explains.  Its research shows that based on current technology, the three types of activities most susceptible to automation are: physical activity or operating machinery in a predictable environment, collecting data and processing data.  It estimates that ""less than 5 per cent of occupations can be fully automated"" and ""about 60 per cent have at least 30 per cent of activities that can technically be automated"".  ""Workers"", it concludes, ""will need to work more closely with technology, freeing up more time to focus on intrinsically human capabilities that machines cannot yet match.""  It would be sweet irony if the entry of robots into the workplace helps us become more fully human. I certainly look forward to that day, and to a machine helping me write better columns.",2017-04-22,That is why I disagree with the way technological advances and the ... and AI are more often than not viewed - not just in Singapore but in other ...,Please stop saying I'll be replaced by a robot,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/please-stop-saying-ill-be-replaced-by-a-robot,1,8,2

2,2,"If you chance upon an empty canoe moving by itself off Seletar Island, do not be alarmed.  The yellow robot kayak roaming the Strait of Johor looking for signs of trouble is the latest weapon in the war against killer algae.  It is armed with sensors that measure water temperature, salinity and chlorophyll, among other things.  Scientists are using it to monitor waters for harmful algal blooms which have killed fish and marine life en masse here in the past.  Scientists simply programme the robot to survey a designated area and collect data in real time that can then be used to map out patches of algae so scientists know how they are spreading.  Since 2010, scientists from the Tropical Marine Science Institute (TMSI) at the National University of Singapore and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Smart) Centre for Environmental Sensing and Modelling (Censam), have been harnessing advanced technologies to monitor environmental stressors, including algal blooms.  The project is funded by the National Research Foundation.  There are 270 known algae species found in coastal waters off Singapore. Here are some: Commonly found in the Johor Strait, it has toxic compounds that are known to cause massive fish kills during blooms. During the mass fish death in 2015, the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore found elevated levels of Karlodinium veneficum in seawater samples. The genus consists of more than 40 species and a third of them are toxic. Four Alexandrium species occur in Singapore waters. One produces a toxic compound that kills young sea bass and seahorses, while another causes paralytic shellfish poisoning, which can be fatal. This genus is known to have 12 species and can release toxins into the environment as aerosols, which can cause respiratory problems in humans. Recreational beaches have been forced to close due to blooms caused by such species. Eating shellfish contaminated with the algae may also result in neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, which causes headaches and aching muscles, among others. An undetermined species was observed in the Singapore Strait in a study published last year.  ""The sea, as a research field, is a very challenging environment to collect data. Autonomous fleet of vehicles are able to collect relatively more data, more accurately as opposed to traditional methods,"" said Mr Tawfiq Taher, a senior research manager at Smart Censam.  ""Due to the harsh nature of the sea, the robots are required to be robust and resilient to the extreme weather conditions.""  Local fish farms here have been badly hit by algal blooms in recent years. Just two years ago, 77 farms were affected by the blooms which wiped out 500 to 600 tonnes of fish - about one-tenth of local farms' yearly produce that year .  There are 118 Singapore coastal fish farms in the East and West Johor Strait, and the southern waters, where most rear fish in net cages in the sea. There are another seven fish farms on land.  Last year, the farms produced about 5,000 tonnes of fish, accounting for about 10 per cent of the fish eaten here.  Dr Sandric Leong, a senior research fellow with TMSI who is co-leading the project, noted that algal blooms are linked to many factors, including slower or warmer water, high nutrient levels and discharge from land agriculture.  ""Advanced technologies assist in finding the blooms which are still in the early development stage so that the public can be alerted,"" he said.  Dr Leong and his TMSI team are also using other technologies to help track and detect algal blooms with greater efficiency.  They include a machine which can identify algae species in a few hours instead of days.  An underwater camera is also able to operate at depths of up to 2km, to capture images of algae lurking deep in the sea.  National water agency PUB is also using technology to monitor reservoirs and waterways. It has developed a life-sized robot swan, with the NUS Environmental Research Institute and TMSI, to measure chlorophyll levels and water quality in reservoirs.  The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) said it monitors the water quality around the nation's fish farming areas.  ""The use of autonomous surface vehicles (ASV) is relatively new in Singapore but such technologies can help to complement AVA's monitoring efforts,"" added a spokesman.  ""On some occasions, we have tapped on the water quality data from NUS' ASV trials to assist in our assessment of water quality in the East Johor Strait.""",2017-03-28,The yellow robot kayak roaming the Strait of Johor looking for signs of ... and the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Smart) ...,Robot kayak joins fight against algae,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/environment/robot-kayak-joins-fight-against-algae,8,1,2

Welcome to the new era of manufacturing, on display this week in an exhibition at the Singapore Expo.  Manufacturing Technology Asia 2017, which opened yesterday, aims to bring businesses large and small, technology providers and service firms together to share experiences and opportunities.  It is in part prompted by the potential created by technological advances.  By interacting with seasoned industry players, businesses will gain a better idea on how advanced manufacturing technologies may be adopted in their own operations.  The event, organised by trade event organiser UBM SES, will also allow businesses to explore technologies already available on the market, connect with providers and work on new solutions.  The exhibition, which comprises 301 companies from 26 countries, is showcasing a spectrum of innovative technology, including additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), optics and photonics, precision engineering and semiconductor manufacturing.  Mr Johan de Villiers, managing director of technology provider ABB, said: ""Adopting new technology is absolutely essential for firms.  ""It ensures the competitiveness of Singapore in a global economy. For a country with limited resources, the ability to use technology will continue to be a key competitive advantage for Singapore.  ""It also presents a key export opportunity for Singapore as it develops a workforce that adds value in the digital environment. Those skills are going to be a large part of the future global economy.""  Ms Sim Ann, Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry, mentioned at the opening ceremony the importance of preparing Singapore's manufacturing sector for technological developments.  She said: ""Advanced manufacturing presents significant opportunities for our economy, companies and people.  ""Events such as the Manufacturing Technology Asia exhibition serve as useful and important platforms for key stakeholders to exchange ideas, and discuss how we can work together to drive the industry's push towards advanced manufacturing.""",2017-04-04,PHOTOS: MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY ASIA 2017 ... they are moved from one conveyer belt to another by tireless robotic arms with pinpoint precision. ... on display this week in an exhibition at the Singapore Expo.,The new era of manufacturing is here at Expo event,http://www.straitstimes.com/business/the-new-era-of-manufacturing-is-here-at-expo-event,5,0,0

6,7,"Businesses in Singapore have long complained about a shortage of labor which they say has pushed up wages. Now they're seeking to push back against labor costs, replacing people, with robots.     Meet e-bot, a food delivery robot that can accept payment go down ramps and take lifts with other staring passengers.    E-bot is employed by e2i, a government agency that assists workers and employers through career guidance and job matching services. Against the backdrop of rising labor cost and a shortage of manpower, e2i wants to showcase e-bot as a possible solution for future employment in Singapore.    ""I think the issue out there is that we need something to be showcased, piloted, tested, test-bedded, so when we first did it, we had to overcome some of these challenges: how the robot communicates with the home base, how do we get the safety of the robot in place, because this is a crowded campus,"" said Gilbert Tan, CEO, Singapore Employment & Employability Institute.    Safe interaction between human and machine is key for a project like this. E-bot is smart enough to avoid obstacles, but sometimes human error could stop it from doing its job. And then, it needs a helping hand.     ""The robot has two emergency locks on the side. Perhaps someone was curious and touched the buttons. E-bot was locked in the lift for a long time. So I went to look for it and unlocked it. It walked back slowly,"" said Aisha Wong, Cafe Worker.    Singapore has allocated more than 320 million dollars to support the national robotics program since last year. The finance minister says robotics technology can enable Singapore to work more efficiently in a tight labor market. It can also create more high value-added jobs.    One company thats convinced that automation and robotics is the way forward is SATS. The airport service and in-flight catering company controls 80 percent of Changi Airports ground handling and catering business.  In the past few years, SATS has managed to grow its business but maintain labor cost, thanks to productivity measures such as robots and automated guided vehicles.  The company CEO says although technologies make the organization a lot more efficient, its the people who are leading the changes.  ""Because the technology on its own without the support of the people wont work,"" said Alexander Hungate, CEO, SATS.  ""The draw back of a lot of these new technologies is that they are fundamentally less flexible than human beings and so you need the human element to work out how they can be best used because its about complimenting the passion and the creativity of people with technology to make them more productive.""

7,8,"They have come up with spin-off companies, new technology and breakthroughs, but the time is up for the five research programmes under the prestigious Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Smart) initiative.  Moving forward, Singapore's National Research Foundation (NRF) - which funds the effort - will look at new proposals and research programmes which are relevant to Singapore, it said.  Meanwhile, the over 200 full-time researchers at Smart, hired on contract basis for the expected term of the research programme, will have to wait and see if their contracts are renewed.  Smart's environmental sciences and infectious diseases programmes will cease when their decade-long term expires at the end of the year. Three other programmes, which research into areas such as future urban mobility, low-energy electronic systems and technologies for the healthcare industry, will also end when their tenures are up from next year onwards.  The five programmes have resulted in a number of spin-off companies. One example is Visenti, a Smart spin-off which manages water technologies and sensors. It has since been acquired by global water technology leader Xylem.  Smart has also worked with the National University of Singapore on a robot kayak, which monitors the waters in the Strait of Johor for harmful algal blooms that killed fish and marine life en masse here in the past.  However, an NRF spokesman pointed out: ""NRF reviews and refreshes the portfolio of programmes... as part of a continuous process to increase the impact of research conducted.""  A Smart spokesman told The Straits Times that it has submitted a proposal for a new research programme, Urban Sustainability and the Environment. NRF, however, said it has not accepted the proposal, although it could follow up on some ""promising"" areas.  ""Smart will work with NRF to identify possible partners for collaboration,"" said the NRF spokesman.  Smart, established to much fanfare in 2007, is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) largest, and only, international research centre.  It was the first of several international research centres established under an initial $1 billion initiative called Campus for Research Excellence and Technological Enterprise (Create).  Create, which has also established centres with universities such as Cambridge University, aims to foster joint research programmes between the world's top research universities and Singapore-based research institutes, as well as to recruit and nurture a pool of young talent here.  All NRF-funded programmes at Create are awarded for five years in the first instance and can be renewed once, with a maximum span of 10 years - a process in line with international practices. There are regular reviews, during which the research directions are either reaffirmed, modified or concluded.  Some programmes failed to make it past the five-year mark, including those with the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and Peking University.  NRF has also identified new areas of research that Singapore should invest in. For example, last year, it pumped in $25 million to start a five-year marine science programme to spur research into how the Republic can better cope with emerging challenges such as climate change, heavy shipping and urbanisation.  ""In line with Singapore's Smart Nation initiative, we are also looking to support the development of digital capabilities in areas including cyber security, data science and artificial intelligence,"" said the NRF spokesman.  Dr Erik Velasco, aresearcher from Smart's environmental sciences programme,said the programme was the first environmental research centre in Singapore, and has over the past decade conducted scientific work on topics of relevance for Singapore's sustainability and welfare. The centre has done studies on domestic air quality, haze, and algae blooms, for instance.  The closure of the environmental programme, known as the Centre for Environmental Sensing and Modelling, was a loss of human capital and knowledge. ""I am pretty sure other institutes will continue the research work started... Hopefully, they will follow the same approach of openness to the public.""  However, Dr Velasconoted that the closure was an opportunity for NRF to review its programmes and policies according to Singapore's needs. ""Singapore needs to invest in scientific institutions and not just in research projects. Permanent institutions will provide sustained advice and support to both the authorities and society. Singapore needs to rely on knowledge generated by scientists based in Singapore. Such scientists need to be part of Singapores society and share its problems. Famous and well reputed scientists working somewhere else may provide good advice, but wont be able of identifying such problems neither of providing adequate solutions.""

8,9,"McKinsey & Company's new Singapore Digital Capability Centre (DCC), opening on April 11, will help local companies harness emerging technological changes - collectively known as Industry 4.0 - that are disrupting industries around the world, according to Oliver Tonby, McKinsey's South-east Asia managing partner.  MCKINSEY & Company's new Singapore Digital Capability Centre (DCC), opening on April 11, will help local companies harness emerging technological changes - collectively known as Industry 4.0 - that are disrupting industries around the world, according to Oliver Tonby, McKinsey's South-east Asia managing partner.  Mr Tonby said Industry 4.0 describes four broad disruptions. They are: increasing data availability and interconnectivity; analytics and business intelligence (BI) capabilities, including artificial intelligence (AI); advanced human-machine interactions such as cobots (a collaborative robot that interacts with humans in the workplace); and advanced production methods such as 3-D printing.  All these are expected to transform the entire life cycle of a business' product, from customer order to after-sales.  The Singapore centre is part of a global network of five DCCs that McKinsey has around the world. The Singapore centre will be in partnership with A*Star's Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC) and, apart from Singapore, will also serve the South-east Asian region. McKinsey is spending US$15 million upfront in establishing the centre and will employ 10 new full-time employees. According to sources close to the project, McKinsey expects that more investments in the centre will be ongoing as it expands and increases its scope. Most of the money is likely to go into hiring more skilled personnel.  Talking to The Business Times, Mr Tonby noted that with manufacturing accounting for one-fifth of Singapore's economic output, ""the facility is in line with the nation's push to become a regional hub for advanced manufacturing (AM)"".  He added: ""Singapore, in our view, is also uniquely positioned to become the home of smart manufacturing pilots. The DCC is also designed to be especially relevant to regionally important sectors including discrete manufacturing, semiconductors, oil and gas, electric power, and mining.  ""We see DCC Singapore playing an integral role in the ecosystem, drawing on ARTC's state-of-the-art facilities and research and development capabilities across A*Star, ranging from manufacturing, data analytics, virtual process modelling, and digital solutions for complex manufacturing processes.""  David Low, ARTC's CEO, told BT that his organisation would be jointly conducting manpower training sessions with McKinsey for companies to get an appreciation of lean manufacturing and Industry 4.0.  ""These sessions will leverage DCC's learning modules across themes such as predictive maintenance, digitised performance management, procurement and supply chain. The DCC will utilise part of ARTC's Model Factory testbed that will be launched in the later part of the year,"" Mr Low said.  The Model Factory testbed will provide a learning environment for companies to experience advanced manufacturing technologies, so that they can acquire and deepen their knowledge and skills in such technologies, thereby reducing the risks involved in adopting AM in their own factories and processes  ARTC will also groom talent for Future of Manufacturing technologies through workshops and on-the-job training. At any one time, ARTC has at least 30 interns from the various Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) such as NTU (Nanyang Technological University), NUS (National University of Singapore, SUTD (Singapore University of Technology and Design), Singapore Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Nanyang Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic and Temasek Polytechnic.  As new technologies such as robotics, digitalisation, IoT (Internet of Things) and analytics come online, the manufacturing sector is changing dramatically. Advanced manufacturing is one of the areas identified by the Committee on the Future Economy (CFE) as a growth cluster. CFE noted that Singapore should augment its current base of complex manufacturing capabilities, and prepare its workforce to take on the jobs created by the integration and adoption of AM technologies.  Recently German semiconductor giant, Infineon Technologies, announced that it is spending 70 million euros (S$104.8 million) in five years till 2021 to develop a smart factory at its backend manufacturing plant in Singapore. Infineon said it would progressively increase the level of automation, connectivity and control within the factory. It added that Industry 4.0 ""is not only the next step in automation, but will substantially change how we work; machines are becoming more intelligent and will be able - to a large extent - to control and optimise themselves and the production process in which they are involved"".  McKinsey's Mr Tonby said the company's DCCs around the world will simulate different companies, depending on the needs of the region. ""For example, the Singapore facility will feature a gearbox manufacturer whereas the German facility will feature a woven smart wristband producer. Ultimately, the realistic production environment is the biggest differentiator as all centres will feature similar capability learning modules which will be developed in synergy and then tailored to the simulated business.""  He added that the Singapore centre will showcase applications beyond the four pillars of Industry 4.0 - data analytics, robotics, 3-D printing and connectivity - to ""include technologies that can be adopted across the entire value chain encompassing product development, procurement and supply chain"".  The Singapore facility will offer companies at different stages of their Industry 4.0 transformations with the following help:  Among the many technology showcases on offer at the DCC, one will be on predictive maintenance. ""New technology today uses real time data to predict and prevent breakdowns and can reduce down time by 50 per cent. At the DCC, participants will learn about these new technologies and also pilot them on site, before applying them to their own setting. We think this approach can be transformational in the adoption of Industry 4.0,"" Mr Tonby said.  ARTC's Mr Low noted that Industry 4.0 is still a relatively new concept and not all companies are convinced of the value that these technologies can bring them.  Companies need to understand how they will be left behind if they do not adopt Industry 4.0, as the future of manufacturing will see a move towards the replacement of labour-intensive processes with disruptive technologies such as digital manufacturing, robotics and automation, he said, adding: ""To remain relevant, companies must identify and learn about the types of advanced technologies which can make a significant difference to their businesses, and open up new revenue streams.""  Mr Low added that with strong government support in this space, along with a well integrated ecosystem of relevant government agencies, researchers and the industry, Singapore is in a good position in the adoption of Industry 4.0.

9,10,"The city-state will also host an inaugural Defence Technology Summit in 2018 as it looks to become a global player in modern military advancements.  SINGAPORE: A starting seed grant of S$45 million a year will be given to two new laboratories in the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) and DSO National Laboratories organisations, Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in Parliament on Friday (Mar 3).    Modern militaries are powered by technology, and the next-generation SAF (Singapore Armed Forces), even more so, he said. Our defence technology organisations will gear up to support changes.    To foster more experimentation and innovation, DSO will set up a robotics lab in April this year and DSTA will expand to include an analytics and artificial intelligence lab.    At the former, defence engineers will collaborate on prototyping, integration, simulation and testing of systems prior to field trials for the SAF. The work on robotics has already begun, said Dr Ng. Six Singapore Infantry Regiment soldiers are currently experimenting with unmanned aerial and ground vehicles to perform missions. The Navy has gone further and is putting Unmanned Surface Vehicles which can navigate and avoid collisions autonomously into operations.    The SAF, working with the Ministry of Home Affairs, has already developed countermeasures to potential drone attacks. These systems were deployed in the last NDP (National Day Parade).    DSTAs new lab will exploit the real-time information that can be derived from the Internet of Things and platforms, said the minister.    The realisable potential is enormous. For instance, our Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre monitors more than 1,500 commercial shipping vessels in our waters daily. It uses AI to generate unique signatures for each, through collating information from multiple sources, including social media. It then detects any deviations from this signature, he explained.    This AI-embedded method detected a possible ISIS supporter on board a tanker in 2015. That person was barred from disembarking in Singapore. Finding this needle in a big haystack is only possible through modern means.    Singapore will also host an inaugural Defence Technology Summit in early 2018. Targeted as a biennial event, the summit will be organised by DSTA together with Singapores universities, A*STAR and Government agencies like GovTech, Cyber Security Agency of Singapore, National Research Foundation and Singapore Economic Development Board.    Singapore can lead in defence technology, even though we are small, said Dr Ng. The Summit will provide a global platform to invite leading figures and luminaries to come share their views, provide a window into the future, allow us the opportunity to network and increase our access to new ideas and innovation.    In his speech, Dr Ng also revealed that Singapore has around 5,000 defence engineers and scientists, with the number of related scholarships and awards on offer due to be increased by 40 per cent - up to 170 from 120 today - by 2025.",2017-03-02,"Singapore to invest S$45m a year in new defence tech labs for ...

10,13,"Cage-free, user-friendly collaborative robot arms affordable for enterprises of all sizes have now become the market driver within industrial robotics. The 2016 annual result of Universal Robots is a testament to that market growth, with revenue reaching DKK 662 million (US$98.4 million) and delivering a profit of DKK 92 million (US$13.7 million) before tax.  President of Universal Robots, Jrgen von Hollen, considers net income to be satisfactory and expects revenue growth of 50 percent or greater in 2017, which means that the company will stay on target to reach DKK 1 billion (US$148.6 million) by the end of 2017.  We need to stay ahead of the curve and drive innovation in everything we do. Scaling the business to continue to deliver growth year-after-year is a key priority. Compared to 2015, we have more than tripled our investments in 2016, especially in R&D, enabling us to maintain our product leadership position, and allowing us to offer the cobot technology platform of choice, said Jrgen von Hollen. Equally important has been our continued investment of more than 50 percent into the Universal Robots staff resource base in 2016, extending our capability, know-how and reach globally.  Universal Robots continues to gain market share in developing markets, doubling its global presence with local offices in 11 countries, up from five offices in 2015. The company is now represented with a presence in the USA, Spain, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, China, Singapore, India, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. The company also continues to scale a strong distribution channel covering more than 50 countries worldwide.  Eight years after Universal Robots sold its first cobot, the global collaborative robot market has entered a new phase of growth. Before the invention of the cobot, automation of manufacturing facilities was limited to highly structured tasks. As a result, many industries had to rely on hand assembly for the more dynamic and flexible functions in their production processes. However, with the Universal Robots cobot, companies are now able to apply flexible, easy-to-use, safe technology allowing them to scale and grow their businesses.  The advantage of Universal Robots cobot is its universal application for all sizes of companies, from small to large. Our technology has been an enabler for all companies  not just large corporations  to integrate automation into their production processes. What also differentiates us has been our focus on growing a global eco-system of technology partners in our UR+ platform. The UR+ platform offers customers access to application solutions leveraging a global developer resource base that is continuously innovating, said Jrgen von Hollen.  As a first mover and leading cobot manufacturer, Universal Robots has been able to rapidly grow its global market share, taking advantage of the impressive growth of the market to date. We are committed to grow our market share as the collaborative robot market experiences continued, explosive growth over the coming years as small and medium businesses adopt cobot technology, said Jrgen von Hollen.  In the spring of 2015,Teradyne, a leading supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications, acquired Universal Robots. The close collaboration between Teradyne and Universal Robots has allowed Universal Robots to leverage Teradynes global coverage and capabilities.  Universal Robots was co-founded in 2005 by the companys CTO, Esben stergaard, who wanted to make robot technology accessible to all by developing small, user-friendly, reasonably priced, flexible industrial robots that are safe to workwith. Since the first robot was launched in 2008, the company has experienced considerable growth with the user-friendly robots now sold in more than 50 countries worldwide.

11,14,"Nadine starts work this Saturday at the Nanyang Technological University, and could one day assist lawyers and journalists. Talking Point asks: Could she replace your job  Nadine starts work this Saturday at the Nanyang Technological University, and could one day assist lawyers and journalists. Talking Point asks: Could she replace your job  SINGAPORE: In a black dress, with flowy brunette hair and soft skin, Nadine has her own distinct personality and makes eye contact with you. Not only does she recognise the people she meets, she also remembers past conversations.  Come this Saturday (Jun 25), the life-like socially intelligent robot, who has been making waves around the world, is set to start work as a receptionist at Nanyang Technological Universitys (NTU) Institute of Media Innovation.  What is significant about this moment is that it could herald a future where social robots like her take on certain jobs once thought do-able only by humans.  The 1.7m tall Nadine was created by a team of scientists headed by Professor Nadia Thalmann, director of the Institute of Media Innovation. Nadine is a ground-breaking project developed to address manpower needs in the administrative and healthcare sectors  for instance, assisting the elderly at home, when caregivers are in short supply.    Said Prof Thalmann, in an interview with current affairs programme Talking Point: If you have a Nadine companion that can help you, give you medication, call others for you, its a dream.  But the advent of a social robot like Nadine  who can express moods and emotions, and interact and communicate with humans to a degree that robots have not previously  also poses a challenge to human employees and future job-seekers.    Seen by some in the field as the epitome of artificial intelligence, Nadine grasps things quickly, acts in response to the situation and is programmed to work efficiently for long hours.  As a receptionist, she can say goodbye and good morning, and keep a list of what to do. She will take documents we hand to her, read them and, being a computer, keep it filed. She will do it perfectly, and better than a standard receptionist, said Prof Thalmann, on whom Nadine's looks are modelled.  There are other robots that can also assist in more complex professions, such as law and journalism, said the professor.  Acting as a huge database, such robots could answer standard questions and aid journalists in understanding texts or sorting out information. They could help lawyers retrieve past cases efficiently and apply specific laws to specific cases, she noted.  ARE HUMANS IN DANGER OF BEING REPLACED  But could robots one day take over the jobs of lawyers and journalists Just how concerned should humans be about being replaced by the likes of Nadine  Prof Thalmann reckons it could be a matter of five, 10 years for robots to effectively take over repetitive jobs as receptionists, restaurant cleaners or drivers (in the form of self-driving cars).  Anything beyond 10 years, however, is difficult to predict  will robots become capable of coming up with unique ideas, or more subtle decision-making It is difficult for now at least, she said.  What observers believe that is that todays emerging technology will not permanently displace most of the workforce, so much as shift the jobs into other sectors.  Mr Aziz Amirali Merchant, a member of the Future of Manufacturing Steering Committee, said human talent is needed to drive and grow the robotic workforce, to design, develop, manufacture, train, maintain and repair these robots.  This, he said, is where STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) training is important - and by focusing on it, a new workforce will be created and this could provide very good paying jobs for Singaporeans.  Prof Thalmanns view is that the Government should train people for other kinds of jobs where the robots are not there. She likened to it to how when computers came on the scene, many jobs were lost, yet without the computer, we would be lost. 3D printing is another development that has made some work obsolete.  So you see, she added, we cannot stop these kinds of know-how. The question is, how can we give the background, the knowledge to people so they can serve in another sector where we need them.

SINGAPORE: Much like how personal computers transformed the way people saw and used technology, Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation Programme Office Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said the personal, general-purpose robots would revolutionise the way such technologies feature in people's lives.    He was speaking on Friday (Feb 10), at the opening panel discussion of this years Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Hacking Medicine  a weekend-long hackathon aimed at finding solutions to improve healthcare and eldercare through the use of personal robotics.    ""This revolution of the personal general-purpose robot - capable of sensing, processing and doing things, would be even bigger than the revolution that was brought about in the last 30 years by the personal computer, said Dr Balakrishnan, to an audience of around 160 participants including engineers, clinicians, designers, developers, researchers and business people.    We want Singapore to be one of these nodes where new ideas, crazy ideas, will change the world. Will liberate human beings from the burdens of age. Will help us remain masters of our lives and still retain our humanity, still retain our connections with other human beings and make life better.    Participants will develop software and hardware applications on Loomo  a Segway robotic platform, in focus areas of mental health, rehabilitation and recovery, community care or long-term care. These would allow the robots to become robot assistants capable of understanding and engaging with elderly, as well as patients with conditions such as Alzheimer's and others. Participants may also define a suitable challenge statement based around the theme of Social Robotics for Eldercare.    Dr Balakrishnan reminded participants that such solutions had to address real human needs and remain safer than existing technology or treatments. They also had to be more cost effective and financially accessible to all, while remaining acceptable and resonate with human beings on a psychological and emotional level.    When youre dealing with physical devices capable of sensing and responding in a very sophisticated way, that whole usability and human-robot interface is going to be a very rich field for research and development, said Dr Balakrishnan.    Winners of the hackathon will be announced on Sunday, with a top prize of US$5,000. Their projects will also be featured on a panel at EmTech Asia on Feb 15, while selected teams will be supported by agencies such as government-owned private innovation entity SGInnovate to further refine and scale-up solutions.    At the end of that well put some money behind those with real potential, because wed also like to build not only for Singapore, but for other countries as well, said SGInnovates Founding CEO Steve Leonard.    Healthcare is a really big challenge for us. And we think about providing care for people in that age  they need more help physically, they need more help mentally, and thats why we think this robotics platform allows us to find new ways to provide that care.

13,16,"Have you ever imagined yourself creating a complex machine part or even a human windpipe on a screen, then seeing it take on physical form right before your eyes  Or leading a team of tireless workers who need to be reprogrammed once in a while  These are jobs already being done by 3D designers and robot coordinators. Not many people have the skills to do these jobs yet, because they have not been around for long.  At least not in a big way.  But in the economy of the future, you can expect more jobs like these to be created.     Children learning how to make their own robots using Lego pieces during a holiday workshop on robotics and game design at In3Labs. Robots and computer programs are helping do jobs ranging from delivering room service to providing financial advice, and workers in some industries are already feeling the heat. ST PHOTO: LAU FOOK KONG     While it is hard to identify the specific skills students and workers need to acquire to keep up with these changes, one skill that will come in handy is the ability to continually learn new things.  As Manpower Minister Lim Swee Say said earlier this month, as businesses transform, more old jobs will be destroyed. But new jobs will be created and existing jobs will be transformed too.  What this means for workers is that instead of staying with a single employer for life, it will be common to move through multiple employers - and take on multiple careers - throughout one's working life.  ""Each time we move from one career to another career, we will have to learn new skills and adapt to a new environment to regain our employability, time and time again,"" Mr Lim said.  Understandably, many workers are worried about adapting to these changes, and concerned about how their livelihoods will be affected.  With robots and advanced computer programs helping do jobs ranging from delivering room service to providing financial advice, workers in some industries are already feeling the heat.  But technology also creates new products, such as 3D printing for companies to make prototypes quickly rather than outsourcing this process, and jobs, such as for rapid prototyping technicians.  Jobs will disappear. But better- quality ones will be created.  For example, in advanced manufacturing, some 23,000 jobs are forecast to be displaced over the next seven years, but more than 22,000 new jobs are expected to be created.  These new jobs will pay on average 50 per cent more than those lost, a recent study by Boston Consulting Group found.  SKILLING UP FOR NEW JOBS  However, these changes wrought by technology and other forces also mean the job market will go through some labour pains.  Layoffs last year rose to the highest level since the global financial crisis in 2009. Unemploy- ment involving Singapore residents also crept up slightly.  Professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMETs) are hit harder by the churn as it takes longer to train for a different job at these levels.  People who took a break from work, or who struggled to find a new job after being laid off, often have a hard time proving that they have the relevant knowledge and skills for a job.  This is why the Government is putting more resources into helping this group find new jobs, such as by subsidising their wages via the Career Support Programme.  PMETs can also work and get training at the same time through over 50 Professional Conversion Programmes in sectors that are expected to grow in the near future.  Unlike in the past, a degree is no longer a guarantee of lifelong employment in a well-paying job.  But opportunities are there for those who excel in technical skills to do well, even if they may not have academic qualifications.  Being quick to pick up new skills will help students and workers adapt to changing opportunities. This entails going deeper to master a chosen field and excel in it.  One tip experts have for workers is to keep abreast of the latest trends and technology, which can help bring in new ideas for employers to try out and add value.  At the same time, they recommend picking up transferrable skills that can be applied in other jobs or industries, such as being able to understand and use data, or to market an idea.  The Committee on the Future Economy has called for more opportunities for workers to acquire deep skills and use them on the job.  A medley of initatives is available to help students and workers upgrade their skills and knowledge, including study awards, work-study programmes, internships and career guidance from as early as primary school.  The $500 SkillsFuture Credit given to all Singaporeans aged 25 and above can be used to defray the cost of over 18,000 training courses.  Other measures have been put in place to help those who have years of work experience, but may not have the skills needed in sunrise industries, find new jobs.  One is the new Attach And Train programme announced in this year's Budget for up-and-coming industries like logistics. Workers can be trained while on attachments at companies that are not ready to hire staff yet.  As more focus is placed on pushing Singapore companies to break out of the local market and start creating products and services for the region and beyond, students and workers will also be encouraged to innovate and learn to work with overseas partners.  Policymakers, too, are constantly trying to learn more about what the future holds for Singapore's workforce.  Data is one aid they hope to use to help answer questions like these: How much investment is Singapore getting How many jobs will these create Which industries and companies will grow What skills will workers need for these jobs  Answers to these questions will help better prepare workers for jobs and later match them to jobs.  The National Trades Union Congress started a Future Jobs, Skills and Training unit this year to gather data on specific companies and industries where new investments and jobs will be over a three-year time frame.  The research will be shared with training providers and institutes of higher learning that can use the information to develop more relevant skills and training courses.  There have also been calls to use the data from the job posts on the national Jobs Bank more fully. For example, if a vacancy for a particular type of job is hard to fill and keeps getting re-posted, that could mean more Singaporeans need more skills in that area.  The Manpower Ministry has also made it compulsory, since Jan 1, for companies to report retrenchments within five working days, if five or more staff are retrenched within six months. This is so that the Government and unions can act on the data and offer the affected workers help more quickly.  If we wait for skills gaps to appear before workers start training for them, there will always be a lag time and the risk of structural unemployment - where the available skills of workers and the skills needed to fill jobs do not match.  That is why Singapore is trying to stay ahead of the curve.  It has rolled out Industry Transformation Maps to chart strategies for 23 industries, covering over four-fifths of the nation's gross domestic product.  Six have been launched, for the logistics, hotels, precision engineering, food manufacturing, food services and retail industries.  These should provide some guidance for companies.  The education system also needs to be tightly integrated with industry needs, all the way from schools to adult education and training centres, to provide guidance for students and workers.  For all the efforts by the Government, individuals, too, must take responsibility for their careers, and not have a sense of entitlement.  When changes come, those who can pick up new skills quickly will fare better.  So if there is any skill to get better at, it is the ability to keep learning.

14,17,"Check out the stunning views from the North Star observation capsule.  For those who are not fond of flying, going on a cruise provides an excellent alternative.  As big cruise ships go, Royal Caribbean International cruise line has been a popular choice with travellers.  Almost every year, it unveils a new ship packed with more impressive features.  Ovation of the Seas is the third in the Quantum Class, and this latest ""smart ship"" is also the cruise line's most technologically advanced.  Built last year, it can accommodate up to 4,819 passengers.  Cutting-edge innovation greets guests at the Bionic Bar, where drinks are mixed with acute precision and served by robot bartenders. It is so impressive that there is always a crowd standing there to marvel at the robots in action.  Another technologically-enhanced feature is its radio-frequency identification (RFID) wristbands which can replace its Sea Pass cards, allowing stateroom access and on-board purchases.  Non-fans of cruises tend to feel that there is nothing much one can do on a vessel for more than a day. Ovation of the Seas has certainly changed my mindset in this regard.  Throughout my three-night getaway cruise to Penang earlier this month, I found myself spoilt for choice with the number of facilities available.  The ship features some unprecedented first-at-sea experiences such as the Ripcord by iFly, an adrenaline-inducing skydiving simulation for thrill-seekers; North Star, a mechanical observation capsule that transports guests about 100m above sea level for a 360-degree view of the ocean; a huge entertainment and indoor sports complex complete with bumper cars, roller-skating and more.  You can even try your hand at rock climbing or learn surfing on board.  For those who prefer to relax or swim, dip pools and jacuzzies are aplenty, and strategically located to give you breathtaking views of the sea.  If the sun is not your friend, then head to the indoor pool.  In the evenings, guests can catch a movie under the stars, or dance the night away at the outdoor pool deck.  Ovation also boasts Royal Caribbean's largest and most advanced staterooms.  There are unique loft suites and ground-breaking virtual balcony staterooms, bringing an exterior view to interior rooms through huge digital displays.  The Ovation has 16 restaurant concepts and signature dining venues, as varied as what you may find in most cities. At Cafe@Two70, you get a panoramic view of the sea.  The luxurious dining space transforms into a technologically-advanced entertainment arena in the evening, equipped with 18 projectors and floor-to-ceiling windows that can be transformed into any scene, creating an immersive experience for passengers.  The awe-inspiring talent showcased on board are testament to Royal Caribbean's high entertainment standards that combine technology and special effects - make sure you pre-book your seat for the shows as they run out early.  Travellers on the Ovation can also enjoy what is reportedly the fastest Internet at sea for a reasonable fee.  Ovation of the Seas will have a Hong Kong season in October. It will sail round-trip from Hong Kong on fivenight cruises to destinations such as Okinawa (overnight), Hue/Danang (Chan May) and Nha Trang (Cam Ranh) in Vietnam.  Theres also a nine-night repositioning cruise from Hong Kong to Singapore in November with stopovers at Sanya, Hue/Danang (Chan May), Nha Trang (Cam Ranh) and an overnight in Ho Chi Minh City (Phu My).

16,19,"Robots may soon take over cleaning and painting high-rise buildings here, thanks to a new automated gondola system co-developed by Singapore electronics company Elid Technology International and Nanyang Technological University (NTU).  Called the OutoBot, the locally built system was launched yesterday as a commercially ready product after two years of research and development, with the aim of improving productivity while enhancing workplace safety.  The robot was developed in response to a 2015 call by the Housing Board for proposals to automate the painting of building facades to enhance worker safety and productivity. It will soon be tested on selected public housing blocks in consultation with HDB.  The robot requires only two workers for the washing or painting of a building facade, instead of the usual five.  One worker will operate the robot remotely while the other performs the role of a safety officer, but both do not have to be on the gondola.  OutoBot is equipped with a robotic arm and a spray nozzle that can shoot high-pressure water jets to clean surfaces or to spray paint. The system is designed to use the existing gondola mounts found in many high-rise buildings.  Most of the fatal accidents at construction sites in the last decade were the result of a fall from height, though not all involved gondolas. The move towards automation is also in step with recent measures to boost productivity within the construction sector. Said Elid's managing director, Mr Dennis Lim: ""Using our new robot, we have shown that a labour-intensive job can be transformed into one that can be easily done by an older worker and, at the same time, eliminates the risk of employees having to work at heights.""  Elid claims that OutoBot's current iteration is able to reduce painting and cleaning time by 30 per cent and paint wastage by 20 per cent as it ""does not suffer from fatigue"". A high-rise building typically takes around three months to paint, said Mr Lim.  But Elid was tight-lipped on the cost to use the technology.  Building maintenance contractor Yeong Wai Teck said the technology looks promising and, if successful, could address labour woes in the construction sector.  Said the managing director of Aegis Building and Engineering: ""With the OutoBot, we can potentially look to hire younger people who are interested in technology, or older people who might not be physically able to brave the weather on a gondola for an entire day.""  He added: ""It is going to be very expensive, but we think that in the long term, the overall advantages of automation will outweigh the initial costs.""",2017-03-15,"Robots that paint, clean HDB blocks to be tested shortly ... co-developed by Singapore electronics company Elid Technology International and ...","Robots that paint, clean HDB blocks to be tested shortly",http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/robots-that-paint-clean-hdb-blocks-to-be-tested-shortly,0,2,8

AsianScientist (Nov. 23, 2016) - SGInnovate, Singapores concerted effort to take deep technology to the world, was launched on Tuesday to great fanfare.  The crowd of researchers, innovators, venture capitalists and industry mentors was treated to a dramatic opening video sequence at 32 Carpenter Street, a six-storey building in town that will be SGInnovates official headquarters.  In attendance was guest-of-honor Mr. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapores Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic and Social Policies, Ms. Yong Ying-I, Chairman of SGInnovate, and Mr. Steve Leonard, Founding CEO of SGInnovate.  Wholly owned by the Singapore government, SGInnovate will connect tech entrepreneurs with industry mentors and venture capitalists, and provide support for business plan development, sources of funding, and go-to-market efforts.  Tharman encouraged budding entrepreneurs in the room to create deep technology that had global applications.  SGInnovate, which was announced earlier this year as part of the Budget 2016, falls under the National Research Foundation of Singapore. It was formerly known as Infocomm Investments Pte Ltd, the venture investment arm of the former Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore.  Here at 32CS, which is short for 32 Carpenter Street, engineers and research scientists from the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, McLaren Applied Technologies, NVIDIA and Ethereum will work side-by-side with researchers from varsity partners National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore Institute of Technology and Singapore University of Technology and Design.  The Intellectual Property Office of Singapore, which is represented at SGInnovate by its subsidiary, IP Value Lab, will help founders protect their innovations and identify commercialization opportunities.  SGInnovate has also partnered UK-based Entrepreneur First to launch the inaugural Singapore EF program, a full-time, six-month-long program that began in September 2016. Nearly half of the 55-member cohort are PhD students and post-doctoral fellows from local universities.  Young entrepreneurs will also benefit from upcoming initiatives such as AI Evenings @ SGInnovate, which will be supported by partners such as NVIDIA and McLaren Applied Technologies, and MIT Hacking Medicine, which will be co-organized with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 10-12 February 2017.  Our basic premise at SGInnovate is simple: we believe that Singapore has all of the resources that it needs to build globally relevant products and globally relevant companies, Leonard said at the launch.

18,21,"Drivers headed to Robinson Towers in the Central Business District will no longer have to worry about wasting time circling the building's carpark for a vacant space.  When the building reopens in the fourth quarter of next year, after a five-year redevelopment, it will feature a new automated system that makes use of robots to park cars.  Guided by lasers, cameras and markings on the ground, the robots will ferry cars of up to 2,600kg from a drop-off point to one of 90 parking spaces.  The system, developed by engineering firm MHE-Demag, is believed to be the first such application of the technology in Singapore.  Though such robots have been used for several decades to transport goods, the technology has more recently made inroads into carparks in the United States and Germany.  The system could increase the capacity of a carpark by more than 40 per cent as it allows cars to be parked closer together. The relatively small size of the robot - 5m long and 2.1m wide - also allows it to manoeuvre in narrow spaces.  Unlike other mechanised parking systems, this one does not require steel supporting structures or parking pallets, said MHE-Demag sales and markets regional director Klaus Schilling.  ""No additional building provision is required for the system and it can be adapted into a conventional parking provision in any building development easily,"" he said.  While the firm declined to say how much it will cost, a similar system by Chinese firm Yee Fung Automation - introduced in Nanjing last December - is said to have a price tag of around $200,000.  But the parking fee at Robinson Towers will be ""similar"" to other carparks in the area, said Mr Schilling.  Across the road, at CapitaGreen, daytime parking costs $3.10 a half-hour on weekdays.  Conventional mechanised parking systems - which use mechanical car lifters to move a car to a storage space - can be found at several locations here, including three Housing Board carparks in Changi Village, Yishun and Bukit Panjang.  During peak periods, retrieving a car from these carparks can take 10 to 15 minutes.  MHE-Demag said its system offers faster parking and retrieval, and the average time to retrieve a car - which can be done with a mobile app - will be about two minutes.  The firm is looking at introducing the technology at ""several other locations"", but did not disclose details, and has also started to introduce it elsewhere in the region.  Robotics expert Marcelo Ang said that while it will make parking more convenient, the high cost of purchasing and maintaining such a system could deter widespread adoption of the technology.  ""Building owners will have to weigh how much it costs against what benefits it will bring,"" said Dr Ang, who is acting director of the National University of Singapore's Advanced Robotics Centre.",2017-02-07,"Guided by lasers, cameras and markings on the ground, the robots will ferry ... to be the first such application of the technology in Singapore.",Where carpark valet is a robot,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/where-carpark-valet-is-a-robot,3,1,4
19,22,"HEFEI, April 23 (Xinhua) -- The high-tech development zones and the advanced technology research centers in east China's Anhui Province provide a variety of innovative technologies that can represent leaps in the fields of medicine, education, agriculture, communication and others.  The development of those innovative technologies make a real difference in the life of the Chinese people and even the rest of the world in general.  Located in the provincial capital city of Hefei, the exhibition hall of the Institute of Advanced Technology of the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) displays significant medical technologies, such as immunity improvement tablets for HIV patients, anti-diabetes pills to replace injections for diabetics, a medical scanner that can be used by dentists to scan jaws and screen display 3D pictures of the patient's teeth, an alternative for eye cornea that would put an end to cornea donations and many others.  ""Instead of injection that hurts, diabetics can take the new pills that equally work. It's in the fifth clinical trial in the United States right now and I think it may be available in the market next year. For HIV tablets, we used to costly import them from Western countries. Now they are produced in China,"" said Miao Miao, administrative director of the Institute of Advanced Technology of the USTC.  The hall features some other advanced technologies that are based on the institute's research and carried out by related Chinese companies, such as a hotel service robot, which can be sent by receptionists to a guest's room carrying inside what the guest asks for, and a cell phone chip engraving device that used to be costly imported from Western countries.  The hall also showcases an agricultural machine that can refine harvested rice from straws, a super big high-definition screen of about 110 inches, the largest in China, and an electronic Mandarin-written book attached with a pen that pronounces the words it points to in Tibetan language. The hall also has two average-sized, well-shaped electronic cars with rechargeable batteries.  ""We call the smaller one a 'small ant.' It's all made of aluminum to be very light. It can be charged for 10 hours per drive of 250 kilometers. The bigger one here that costs 20,000 U.S. dollars and goes 300 kilometers each drive has been available in the market since 2016,"" Miao said.  In a room on the second floor, Jia Jia, a robot that looks like a pretty Chinese young woman in traditional outfit, could communicate with visitors and answer their questions with a sense of humor.  Established in 1991 and ranking as one of the Top Ten high-tech zones in China, Hefei National New and High Technology Industrial Development Zone now covers an area of 128 square kilometers and hosts over 18,000 companies, 400 of which are foreign-invested businesses with more than 20 branches listed in stock markets abroad.

21,24,"Japan is ahead of the curve in robotics technology, and Singapore can tap this expertise to meet its challenges in productivity, eldercare and energy efficiency, Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in Tokyo yesterday.  These are issues that Japan also faces, and Singapore has been watching developments in the North-east Asian nation very closely, he told reporters at the end of his four-day introductory visit to Japan.  One key challenge the two states face, he said, is boosting productivity amid a tight labour market.  There is an ""added sense of urgency"" because the size of the local workforce has started to shrink in Japan and will be reaching its peak in Singapore, given low birth rates.  In last month's Budget, Singapore earmarked more than $450 million for the National Robotics Programme over the next three years to help firms adopt robotics technology so as to boost productivity, noted Dr Balakrishnan yesterday.  This would also involve training to equip the workforce with skills to work with robotics, which he called a ""new and promising"" area.  ""We're hoping Japanese companies have an opportunity to engage in investment and transfer of technology (which) will be mutually beneficial to our countries,"" said Dr Balakrishnan, who is also the Minister-in-charge of the Smart Nation initiative.  Eldercare is another mutual challenge, and Dr Balakrishnan said it was worth studying how Japan has extensively tapped robotics in nursing and caring for senior citizens.  ""Issues such as dignity and convenience require design thinking (in) the interface (and) the way humans relate. You can't change humans, but you can change and redesign the machine interface,"" he said, adding that this would require further research and development.  A third area was energy efficiency. Dr Balakrishnan, who was formerly Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, said Singapore has worked well with Japan leading up to the recent conclusion of climate change talks.  This had culminated in 175 countries signing an accord last Friday to curb climate change.  Dr Balakrishnan, who represented Singapore at the ceremony, said yesterday: ""The impetus to focus on energy efficiency is even more urgent. We're looking at how some of the Japanese technologies for energy efficiency and robotics, which Japan is very advanced in, can also be imported or applied in Singapore.""  Beyond Singapore's ties with Japan, the Foreign Minister also touched on China and the South China Sea. He reiterated the Republic's stance that it is not a claimant state in the vital sea and does not take any sides on the merits of competing territorial claims.  He said: ""We want a rules-based multilateral world order, we want to have avenues for the peaceful resolution of differences with full respect for diplomatic and legal processes.""  Dr Balakrishnan's trip coincided with the 50th anniversary of Singapore-Japan diplomatic ties that were established on April 26, 1966.  Besides robotics, Dr Balakrishnan yesterday also cited trade and air services as two areas for even closer collaboration.  The landmark Japan-Singapore Economic Partnership Agreement is currently under review, he noted, while Singapore has been promoting the further liberalisation of a bilateral air services agreement.  ""Our airports - Narita and Haneda in Tokyo and Changi in Singapore - can increase our positions as vital air hubs,"" he said, through having more flights and fifth freedom rights on both sides.

22,25,"Cloud computing has the potential to revolutionize the field of robotics, but there are key considerations to look into before you leap.  AsianScientist (Oct. 29, 2016) - By Oliver Tian - According to the International Federation of Robotics Statistical Analysis, the global robotics industry is projected to grow from US$20 billion today to US$80 billion by 2025.  China, already the global leader in the robotics sales market, is targeting to achieve a robot density of 150 industrial robots per 10,000 workers by 2020. Not to be outdone, Japan has plans to triple its spending on intelligent machines to 2.4 trillion yen by 2020.  Against the backdrop of a tightening labor market and rising manpower costs, adopting robotic technology could boost productivity while strengthening competitiveness and generating growth at the same time, thus helping to retain staff. Robotics is also one of the pillars of Singapores future economy, with strong government support in the form of the National Robotics Program.      Robotics on the cloud  But when planning to deploy robotic applications, we need to think about how each application can be quickly assimilated into our existing work systems, and at what scale. The best way to do this is to choose technology and business partners that have flexibility and scalability built into their offerings, so that when the time comes, you can seamlessly expand into new markets as necessary.  One key consideration for enabling robotic systems is cloud computing. Like the human brain, the cloud receives signals from sensors and actuators which are analogous to the limbs of the body. In turn, the limb nodes receive instructions from the brain to take action.  Like reflex nerves, however, some robotic touch points may have embedded logic to respond instantaneously, bypassing the cloud. Such local processing is a reflexive action rather than an analytical response to a trigger or change in status. Some degree of short-term memory and local processing power can be located in the robot itself for these unthinking reactions, but context and long-term memory are ultimately provided by the cloud. Such a design provides continued functionality in the event of temporary disconnection with the cloud.  Advanced artificial intelligence needs massive back-end computing power and memory management to support the decision making needed for robotic perception. The more powerful the robot (in terms of decision making and processing), the more powerful the back office will need to be. In other words, increasing robotic sophistication increases the potential to offload compute-intensive tasks like image processing, voice recognition, data comparison and analytics with high latency decision making, to the cloud.      The challenge of communication  Whilst the processing capability of the cloud is important, what makes robot applications unique is the potential of the cloud to both mess-up and make sense of the robots context based on the huge volume of data collected. Upon smart filtering and analysis, this tacit intelligence can complement other continuous inputs coming from the robots own sensors. Furthermore, centralized processing will also enable multiple robots to be made aware of information, resulting in extended synchronization.  Sometimes referred to as the hive mind, this architecture will not only be able to process disparate data, but also be able to store huge amounts of information, securely and in an organized way. As such, certain key robotic functions could be made available as a service on-demand. These on-demand robotic functions will drive more and more advanced robotic processing capability.  Just as humans try to work together in teams, robots generally also need figure out how to operate in tandem. Questions that arise include how robots will communicate with the brain in the first place, and how they will then translate that intelligence to other robots and their human counterparts. This communication will require some kind of mediator. However, not all companies seeking to implement robotics solutions have a firm understanding of these underlying challenges.  Today, businesses in every industry around the world are demonstrating that robotics is more than just hype. Your company could be the next to unlock new profitable business models, foster innovation and create amazing new experiences for your customersas long as you approach robotic applications with an open mind and a clear understanding of its potential for your business!  All these and more will be discussed at the upcoming inaugural edition of the Singapore International Robo Expo, a conference and exhibition co-organised by the Singapore Industrial Automation Association (SIAA) and Experia Events. The event will be held from November 1-2, 2016, at the Marina Bay Sands Convention and Exhibition Centre in Singapore.     Mr Oliver Tian is the president of SIAA and the CEO and director of HutCabb Services. SIAA drives Automation, IoT, and Robotics (AIR), with robotics as one of the key pillars in our charter. The association has embarked on this robotic journey to bring automation to a different level and we believe the assimilation of man and machine functions can be a potent force to be reckoned with.

23,26,"Standing at just 1.4m, Hospi, Changi General Hospital's (CGH) newest porter, still gets the occasional stare as it moves along the building's corridors.  That is because it is not human. It has a computer screen for a face, and a cold, hard, white body to match.  But it can move almost as well as a person, with the ability to avoid obstacles, take the lift and move from room to room to deliver items without supervision, and has, since last year, taken on some of the work of porters at the hospital.  CGH is not alone in turning to intelligent mechanical helpers. Over at the National University Hospital, a robotic system automatically picks up and packs medicine at its pharmacy, even keeping track of expiry dates.  Healthcare is a notoriously labour-intensive affair, where ferrying a single bed-bound patient to get an X-ray requires the combined effort of two hospital staff. Each day hundreds of trips are also taken on foot to deliver medicine, medical samples and reports across hospital floors.  It is against this backdrop that doctors and scientists alike started dreaming up ideas of robotic employees some 10 years ago - visions that are starting to take shape today.  These intelligent machines are only going to get closer to patients, eventually even helping to lift them off their beds, says Nanyang Technological University (NTU) don Ang Wei Tech.     Above: Microbiological testing laboratory Ugene Laboratory Services invested in a $1.5 million robot to do routine tasks like weighing samples and to conduct simple tests for bacteria like E. coli. PHOTOS: LIM SIN THAI, MARCUS TAN, AZIZ HUSSIN FOR THE STRAITS TIMES     Associate Professor Ang, who is associate chair of research at the School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, said such a robot is still a few years away, but he has his sights set on creating one that can move three patients on their hospital beds at once, with just one person to supervise it.  The university is one of many academic institutions, companies and start-ups worldwide that are trying to gain a foothold in the multibillion-dollar robotics industry. And healthcare is just one sector that robotics has infiltrated.  The industry is exploding and disrupting life as we know it.  CHEAPER AND SMARTER    Robots first made their mark in the manufacturing industry in the 1970s, taking on mundane and repetitive tasks such as assembling different machine parts - all done in the confines of cages built specially for them in factories.     Above: A robotic arm in NUH automatically picking up and packing medicine at the pharmacy. The machine is part of the Outpatient Pharmacy Automation System that went live in November 2014. . PHOTOS: LIM SIN THAI, MARCUS TAN, AZIZ HUSSIN FOR THE STRAITS TIMES     But in recent years they have morphed into the collaborative robots or ""co-bots"" that work alongside humans, equipped with better sensing capabilities for safety and higher levels of artificial intelligence, and now have ventured out of their cages and factories.  Experts attribute this to advancements in mobile computing technology that have driven down the cost of micro-controllers - essentially computers on a chip that give robots their artificial intelligence - from $10,000 a decade ago to about $200 today.  The cost of force control sensors that tell the robot to stop when it makes contact with an obstacle - for example, a human arm - has also fallen from over $10,000 to around $1,000 over the same period, said Prof Ang.     Above: A CGH nurse collecting documents delivered by Hospi, which takes on the work of porters. .PHOTOS: LIM SIN THAI, MARCUS TAN, AZIZ HUSSIN FOR THE STRAITS TIMES     Hence it is now possible for a typical robot with six axes - meaning it can move six different ways - to have a micro-controller and a force sensor at each joint. This makes it far more sensitive to human touch and, hence, safer.  These days robots cut across various sectors, including healthcare, transport, security, logistics and manufacturing - creating an industry that is taking shape as the centrepiece of the next industrial revolution.  The global robotics industry is expected to grow from US$20 billion (S$27 billion) to US$80 billion by 2025, according to the International Federation Report on Robotics Statistical Analysis and EU Roadmap 2013.  Last year, over 240,000 industrial robots were sold - a 12 per cent increase from the year before, with China leading the pack with 68,000 units sold in the country. The International Federation of Robotics has predicted that some 2.3 million units will be deployed on factory floors by 2018 - more than twice as many as in 2009.  But some human workers have paid a high price for the growth of robots. For example, Chinese company Foxconn Technology Group, which supplies electronics to Apple and Samsung, replaced 60,000 employees in its factories with robots.  Research agency Gartner predicts that by 2018 more than three million workers globally will be supervised by ""robobosses"" with the ability to evaluate an employee's performance solely on quantifiable data, such as the angle at which a waiter presents a plate or how quickly he smiles, and without bias. It adds that half of the fastest-growing firms will have fewer employees than smart machines.  However, job losses are much less of a problem for a country like Singapore, where manpower is in short supply, experts said. Dr Satish Lele, senior vice-president of automation and electronics at research agency Frost and Sullivan, Asia-Pacific, said questions about jobs being replaced are usually asked in developing countries that have an abundance of labour, but ""here, robots could be integral in creating the right balance between Singaporeans and foreign labour"".  The Economic Development Board (EDB) said robotics technology could be a way for the city-state - faced with an ageing population, slow population growth and political pressure to limit the inflow of foreign workers - to ""boost productivity amid a tight labour market"".  Besides enabling the continued employment of an ageing workforce through automation of production tasks, robotics allows manufacturing to be done at higher precision, quality, speed and consistency. It also enables tasks to be carried out in areas that are inaccessible to human workers, such as high-temperature and high-pressure environments, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry.  While industrial robots still make up the bulk of all robots deployed worldwide, experts said service robots are likely to be a greater force here. They expect to see many more service robots in the next five years, especially in the healthcare, food and beverage, and hospitality sectors, where labour is hardest to come by.  More robots will take on logistics tasks at hospitals, like the ones at CGH. Others will become waiters, like the robots Lucy and Mary at Rong Heng Seafood restaurant at the East Coast Seafood Centre. They can deliver food to any of the 29 tables on the ground floor of the restaurant in two minutes.  Four-year-old robotics start-up Techmetics has also invented a robot named Techi that can do the job of three hotel staff.  Two have been deployed at Park Avenue Rochester Hotel in Buona Vista, and have taken on the role of housekeeping aides, delivering bottled water, linen and toiletries to hotel rooms. They will be used later to deliver food, luggage and mail to guests' rooms.  Techmetics chief executive Mathan Muthupillai said four more such robots will make their debut at Singapore restaurants, including IndoChine and Kinsa Sushi, in two months, helping to serve food to patrons and clear their dishes.  Without the need for lunch, tea or dinner breaks, and with no ability to fall sick or become tired, robots can be at any employer's beck and call 24/7, said Mr Mathan.  PLAYING CATCH-UP    Right now, Singapore has some catching up to do with other countries because it started to adopt robots rather ""late in the game"", said Professor Tan Sze Wee, who is the executive director of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's Science and Engineering Research Council.  One reason for this, he said, was that ""until recently, manufacturing has largely been driven by labour growth rather than productivity growth, due to having a much younger workforce"".  Prof Ang, agreeing with Prof Tan, said Singapore was too cautious when robotics started to take off back in 2011, when the components needed to build them became cheaper. He and his colleagues approached the Government with proposals for robotics research and funds needed for it, but were turned down.  But in 2014, the Government turned to the NTU team instead for input on a national robotics programme. The same year, Google acquired eight robotics companies.  Still, Prof Ang said he believes that while Singapore lagged behind in adopting robot technology, the Republic is, in fact, on a par with other countries when it comes to robotics innovation.  ""The lack of funding over the last five years made it difficult for robotics technologies developed here to leave the laboratory and move into the market,"" he said. But he added that the tide can turn with the generous funding that the Government is now promising.  To catch up and even jump ahead, the Government announced a $450 million National Robotics Programme during the Budget debate in April this year, to drive the development, test-bedding and deployment of robotics technology in both public and private sectors.  An additional $400 million will also be made available to local small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are keen to automate.  The EDB now sees huge potential in this field. ""Given the global growth potential of new-generation collaborative and service robots, with the right strategy, we see opportunities to nurture robotics into potentially a billion-dollar industry in the next five to 10 years,"" an EDB spokesman said.  That could in turn provide between 2,000 and 3,000 good job opportunities for engineers here, she added.  The Government has set its sights on these sectors: healthcare, transport, security, environment, logistics and manufacturing.  The strategy is to spur innovation in the public and private sectors while concurrently encouraging and supporting the adoption of market- ready robotics technology across manufacturing and services sectors among large, medium-sized and small businesses alike, the EDB said.  Singapore is not without success stories. Semiconductor maker Globalfoundries Singapore, for example, introduced intelligent systems to its factories in 2010 and now has 42 autonomous mobile robots to move materials in its manufacturing line. That has improved labour productivity by 25 per cent.  Researchers at NTU last year unveiled Nadine, a humanoid robot that can answer questions posed to it, remember past conversations and even gauge how a person is feeling by reading facial gestures.  Mr Charlie Ill, investment director at venture capital firm Red Dot Ventures, said the number of robotics start-ups that have come knocking on his door has gone up from just one last year to seven so far this year. The challenge for these start-ups, said Mr Ill, would be to differentiate themselves from the competition, in terms of cost and by providing a suite of software solutions that allows the robot to work independently with minimal human interaction.  ROBOTICS SAVVY    In the future, robots will greet customers at retail stores and give suggestions based on past purchases. They will front restaurants, take orders as patrons queue and help cut waiting times.  In healthcare, they will improve treatment precision in surgery, for example. At home, they will help caregivers and support independent living with assistive technology, said CGH chief executive Lee Chien Earn.  They will also help reshape experiences and business processes. They will create jobs that never existed, and change the concept of what types of jobs are suitable for humans.  ""Through strategic deployment"", the EDB said, ""advanced robotics can potentially help free up resources, enabling our workforce to take on higher-value, more productive jobs"".  Robotics manpower talent will be required at all levels, it added, from operators who can program and work comfortably with robots to engineers and scientists who can design and build the next generation of robots, as well as those who can contribute to research and development.  Also needed are cyber-security teams that can prevent robots from getting hacked, said market analyst Bob Gill from ARC Advisory Group.  To ensure robotics really takes flight here, more thought has to be put into how to retrain workers for new jobs, and to create a new generation of workers who are not just tech-savvy but ""robotics-savvy"", said Prof Tan. ""We need to think about how we train them at schools, at universities, and to get kids interested in robots,"" he added.  As a start, IDA has launched the Robotics and Maker Academy to teach primary and secondary school students to code and program robots. Since 2014, more than 10,000 students have gone through the programme.  The agency also launched the Code@SG movement in 2014, which includes the National Infocomm Competition that allows students to pit their skills in areas like robotics, security, data analytics and coding.  An Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore spokesman said the aim is for young Singaporeans to become confident with coding and robotics technology to help prepare them for a Smart Nation future.  At the end of the day, acceptance is key, said Prof Tan. ""Over time, we have to understand that we should adopt and embrace robots, and to use them as naturally as we use Facebook or e-mail.""",2016-07-08,"The Economic Development Board (EDB) said robotics technology could ...

24,27,"76-year-old Mr Tan is at the doctors for his backache. While he waits for his appointment, a robot trundles up and asks for his symptoms. Later, the doctor prescribes a mobile app with exercises.  This could well be the future of healthcare in Singapore. Its national health robotics lab  Centre for Healthcare Assistive and Robotics Technology at Changi General Hospital  is researching and testing new ways to deliver care and improve staffs productivity.  GovInsider spoke with Selina Seah, the centres director and Assistant Chief Executive of Changi General Hospital, to find out what lies ahead.      Smart hospitals  Singapores ageing population is leading to more complex diseases, people living longer and fewer caregivers  what Seah calls a triple tsunami. The government plans to build smart hospitals to deal with this onslaught using robotics.  Changi General Hospital has started by automating logistics. Transport robots have been working in the hospital since last year, moving documents, drugs, specimens and linen. They navigate obstacles on their own, and are linked with the hospitals fire alarm system for emergencies. The hospital next plans to use robots to move heavier objects, like patient beds.  It is also researching roles for robots to interact directly with people. We are looking at robots to be the interface between humans, she says. For instance, robots could get information from patients while they wait to see a doctor.  A third area for robots is in precision medicine. The hospital is researching whether robots can be used for surgeries and rehabilitation. They can help in making sure that the treatment is consistent and precise, far more than a human, says Seah. Robots would be able to pinpoint the exact location of tumours, for instance, and do less damage doing surgeries.  The hospital is researching whether mobile apps can be used for treatments. We are look at working with certain researchers and also industry players, she says.  Chronic diseases are on the rise, and their treatment involves lifestyle changes. For instance, drugs only do half the work for diabetes, Seah says. Patients must also exercise and watch their diet. How do we prescribe that part and ensure that can be complied to  Mobile apps can help by gamifying healthcare, she says. Apps can track their performance and use the data to motivate patients to change their behaviour. People challenge themselves if there is a goal to be challenged on, Seah says.  Singapore is not the only one looking at health apps. The US Food and Drug Administration is looking at certified mobile health apps, Seah says, while South Korea and European countries are fighting to enter.  Such apps are yet to be clinically trialled, however. They must be tested to ensure that patients recover faster. Its no different from the rigour one needs to go through for drugs, she says.  Even with new treatments, every person reacts uniquely to exercise, drugs and food. Doctors have to try various combinations to find out what works best for each patient. When the trials dont work and diseases get more complicated, it becomes a huge burden to the whole society. This is the problem here for us in Singapore, she says.  Singapore is looking at how it can use personalised treatments to prevent complications. Its a five-year research programme which has just started, Seah says, targeting diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular diseases.  The country has already taken the first step towards it. It has built a national electronic health records system. It is now looking to build predictive algorithms that can analyse data, like blood sugar readings, and recommend personalised treatments. This would be able to alert individuals and hospitals before people fall seriously ill.  The vision for smart hospitals could become a reality in three to five years, she says. A few things that will need to change to make way, however.  Robots will take over some jobs, people will need to be retrained. We foresee the need to transform the workforce in the next five to ten years, Seah says.  Security will have to be improved with the increased use of data analytics. Some mobile health technologies are still hackable, she says. Singapore will need to be a step ahead on cyber security issues.  A third challenge is coordination across government. There are many personal views about robotics, she says, and even more about health robots. Getting all the stakeholders to agree on funding priorities has been a rather long engagement. The health robotics lab plays a crucial role in bringing all the stakeholders on the same page.

26,31,"Local start-up AiTreat says the Singapore basketball team is one of the beneficiaries of its Expert Manipulative Massage Automation (EMMA) robot.  SINGAPORE: A robot capable of giving targeted physiotherapy massages to relieve muscle strains and injuries has been developed by local start-up AiTreat, and was previewed on Monday (Jul 18).    The Expert Manipulative Massage Automation (EMMA) was created by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) graduate and AiTreat CEO Albert Zhang.  Mr Zhang, a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) physician of five years, said: ""TCM is competing with other industries for physically fit people who can learn TCM knowledge. It's pretty difficult. The salaries keep increasing. The clinics are not earning a lot of profit, even though the charge is not low any longer.  ""So we hope, other than the solving the labour shortage, the robot can also bring scientific data. So, TCM (practitioners) can do research, can have scientific support to show to their patients what their condition is, what their improvement is, and what should be done in the future.  ""We have designed EMMA as a clinically precise tool that can automatically carry out treatment for patients as prescribed by a physiotherapist or Chinese physician,"" he added.  Our aim is not to replace the therapists who are skilled in sports massage and acupoint therapy, but to improve productivity by enabling one therapist to treat multiple patients with the help of our robots.""  Physicians will continue to consult patients and perform physical check-ups - assessing what massages and methods are best - while leaving EMMA to the heavy-duty work.    ""Basically, you build a work flow to tell the robot what to do. Then the robot will do the hard and tedious, time-consuming work,"" said Mr Zhang. ""After that, the physician can do the manipulations and the acupuncture. If the physician has a lot of patients; if he's very popular, he can have an assistant to help them operate several robots at the same time, to serve more people and charge a lower price.""    According to Mr Zhang, EMMA is probably the first such robot in the world developed specifically for use by TCM physicians and sports therapists.  EMMA has already been used to treat Singapore's national basketball team using acupoint therapy.  ""There are different levels that the robot masseuse can do, so I think it will target the different needs, especially with team sports, like basketball, where it needs to cater to more than one athlete - all 12 of us,"" said national basketballer Leon Kwek. ""So I think if we had a masseuse for one team, then he would be tired out by the time he reaches the seventh or eighth athlete. I think it helps reduce his workload, at the same time giving - in a way - equal treatment to every single one of us.""  The robot comprises a single robotic arm, capable of highly articulated movements, and also has a 3D-stereoscopic camera for vision, and a customised, fully rotatable 3D-printed massage tip.  To ensure consistent quality of therapy, EMMA is equipped with sensors and diagnostic functions that will measure a patient's progress, as well as exact stiffness of a particular muscle or tendon. These are uploaded to the AiTreats propriety cloud-based intelligence platform for analysis.  The robot has undergone trials at TCM clinic Kin Teck Tong since last week, where it has treated 50 patients.  Said Ms Coco Zhang, Executive Director of Kin Teck Tong: Like many developed countries, Singapore has the problem of an ageing population. Over the next decade, more people are going to suffer from physical ailments such as arthritis and will be seeking treatment.  In our trials with the robot, the experience has been very good, as it can perform most treatments as well as our therapists, she added.  Moving forward, AiTreat will focus on developing its second-generation robot, which is more compact and mobile, the start-up said.

27,32,"A spider-like reconnaissance robot and a rounded toilet bowl devoid of crevices are two of 36 projects that have been awarded the Singapore Good Design Mark this year.  Launched by the Design Business Chamber Singapore (DBCS) in 2013, the mark aims to recognise well- designed products and services. So far, 176 projects have received the award.  While this year's showing is smaller than last year's, when there were 45 winners, DBCS president Tai Lee Siang notes that the quality of projects has improved.  ""I see higher standards of design. There's been stiff competition in the last two years and people have to work harder to get to where they are,"" says Mr Tai, who attributes the smaller pool of entries to the economic slowdown.  Entries are judged according to six criteria, including sustainability, which means that projects had to minimise their environmental footprint.  The mark aims to show the public what good design is and that the concept of design is beyond aesthetics, says Mr Tai. ""People still have a very narrow definition of design. They think that design is about interior or aesthetic design, but everything that you can see, touch and feel has an element of design.""  Here are five winning works.  Inspired by paddy fields around South-east Asia, this Housing Board project features a terraced design, providing inhabitants with panoramic views of the nearby Punggol Waterway.  It is the first HDB project near a waterway to have a rain garden on the circumference of the blocks, which helps filter and purify rainwater before it enters the waterway.  With solar panels installed on the taller buildings, the HDB blocks are self-sustainable in energy as the solar panels alone can power the lighting of the project's public areas, such as the void decks and corridors.  This project was designed by architecture firms Aedas and Group8asia. The design will inspire other similar housing developments along waterways, says HDB's deputy director of design implementation, Mr Quek Ser Bock, 50.  When faced with hazy conditions, many will choose to take a break from exercising outdoors.  However, when faced with that problem in China, Airmotion Laboratories' founder chose instead to come up with this face- mask solution.  Fitted with a PM2.5 filter, which is able to keep out the smallest polluting particles in the air, the mask comes with a tiny built-in fan that allows more air to pass through the replaceable filter.  This allows the user to breathe in more air at a go, says its designer Leonard Tan Bahroocha, 41, who developed the product with the maskmaking company's founder Bibi Ho, 46.  The mask is designed to fit the user's face securely to ensure that no polluted air is let in. Other user- friendly features include adjustable straps that go round the back of the neck instead of at the ears, so it does not interfere with eyewear.  The mask is available at www.falconpev.com.sg and retails at $98, but is now out of stock.  3 SCORPIO URBAN RECONNAISSANCE ROBOT BY SINGAPORE UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY AND DESIGN  This invention seems to have come out of a science-fiction novel as the spider-shaped robot is the first of its kind to be able to crawl, climb walls and roll.  Specially designed for urban reconnaissance missions, the 12cmtall robot is capable of taking photographs and mapping out areas in 2D.  Created by a team from the Singapore University of Technology and Design, the robot will help ensure the safety of its security personnel.  The design was inspired by an endangered spider species, says the project's head researcher, Dr Mohan Rajesh Elara, 34.  ""We looked to nature to extract design principles,"" he says, adding that the robot's rolling feature was inspired by the spider's ability to roll down surfaces with minimal effort.  Despite the complexity of its design, the robot can be operated easily through a mobile application, he says.  For more information, go to temasek-labs.sutd.edu.sg  Unlike bulky, kiosk-like health monitoring stations used by healthcare providers, this portable health monitor was designed with ease of use in mind.  Measuring about 30cm in height, the device can be easily deployed by healthcare personnel and be used to monitor a user's key vital signs, such as blood pressure and weight. This data can then be transmitted to a community nurse through the device's software.  To use the device, a user taps his identity card at the side and the screen will display his health profile. The device also has Bluetooth capabilities, enabling it to work with other measuring devices.  ""Even though the functionalities aren't novel, by bringing them together in such a cohesive package, the Mobile Health Monitor stands out as the first of its kind,"" says the project's lead designer Nigel Geh, 27.  While this rounded toilet bowl - which has fewer crevices on its exterior that could trap dirt - might look simple, it had to be carefully designed to retain its functionality.  For example, it allows users to sit on it comfortably without their calves touching the bottom of the toilet bowl, says its lead designer Tan Boon Han, 29.  The toilet bowl boasts an anti- bacterial coating and is 25 per cent more water-efficient than a regular one, using a maximum of 4.5 litres for a full flush.

28,33,"As technological advancements continue to impact societies, businesses and citizens in Singapore must prepare for jobs to be affected and learn to use new digital tools more effectively.  The government itself would need to ensure its employees could do the same, said Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister-in-Charge of Smart Nation Vivian Balakrishnan. He revealed that the Singapore government's CIO agency GovTech today signed an agreement with the National University of Singapore (NUS) to jointly develop processes and ways to boost cybersecurity in the public sector.  The university also would provide training for 10,000 public servants in data science over five years, said Balakrishnan during his keynote Wednesday at the IoT Asia 2017 conference.  Noting the role of Apple iPhone in driving the smartphone market over just a decade since its debut, the Singapore minister said the volume of mobile internet traffic also had rapidly increased since 2007 when it was measured in petabytes. Today, online traffic from mobile devices was measured in exabytes, clocking 7.2 exabytes a month at end-2016 compared to just 15 petabytes in 2007.  He also recalled how he talked about Boston Dynamics' Atlas robot at the same conference last year, which was able to open glass doors and regain its footing after slipping. Today, Atlas was able to rollerblade and jump over obstacles.  The vast improvements in languages, game playing, and agility, amongst others, within one year demonstrated the pace of learning and skills acquisition of robots far exceeded that of humans, he said.  Jobs would be disrupted and middle-class white-collar work as well as wages would be impacted, Balakrishnan said, noting that this was a real-world challenge that politicians anywhere in the world could not ignore.  He added that it would be ""far too simplistic and populist"" to use walls and barriers as a prescription, likening such efforts as using anaesthesia to numb the pain. Instead, he stressed the need to help businesses and employees adapt to the digital revolution.  ""People, companies, and nations that master technology first will have enormous reach because their market is global. Our challenge is to democratise these new technologies so as to empower all our citizens to harvest the opportunities more broadly,"" he said, adding that this, in turn, would generate jobs.  GovTech's collaboration with NUS, for instance, would develop the necessary syllabus to help public servants better use data and digital tools, he noted. This would improve government services and the way performance was measured. He also urged local companies and employees to determine if their skills were updated and ready to ride the digital revolution.  Balakrishnan also pointed to the Singapore government's various smart nation initiatives, which focused on tapping digital technologies to improve efficiencies and service delivery. Such efforts included the development of a national IoT (Internet of Things) and sensor communication backbone, also dubbed the Smart Nation Platform. This network would facilitate the sharing of data sensors rolled out by government agencies such as lamp posts, which would be tested as nodes for deploying sensors, beacons, and connectivity.  The minister added that four banks--DBS, OCBC, UOB, and Standard Chartered Bank--currently were part of a pilot to access personal information via the Singapore government's MyInfo portal, which enabled citizens to provide their data that then could be used for electronic transactions. In the trial, for instance, citizens could log into their SingPass account so their personal data could be passed on to the bank to facilitate the opening of an account.  The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) also was putting in place plans to deploy a Central Addressing Scheme this year to facilitate digital cash transfers. This would enable mobile phone numbers or business unique entity numbers to be linked to bank accounts, so funds could be transferred without the need to give out bank account details. In addition, MAS was working to introduce a Unified Point of Sale terminal at checkout counters to eliminate the need for different POS terminals and simplify payment platforms for retailers.  The government was keen to encourage the use of electronic payments with such initiatives, Balakrishnan said, noting the current lack of incentive to move to a cashless environment because other payment modes including cash and credit worked so well in the country.  Charles Reed Anderson, founder of Charles Reed Anderson & Associates, also lauded the Singapore government's recent move to reorganise its organisational structure to finetune its focus on smart nation.  This had led to the creation of a new Smart Nation and Digital Government (SNDG) Group, parked under the Prime Minister's Office, to enable the government to be ""more integrated and responsive"". The new unit would comprise employees from three existing government departments including the Ministry of Finance's Digital Government Directorate and the Ministry of Communications and Information's Government Technology Policy department.  Speaking during his keynote at IoT Asia, Anderson said internal collaboration and coordinated efforts were key to successful implementations of IoT and smart city projects. This also would provide a common platform for data sharing, which was critical in IoT-driven initiatives.  Balakrishnan said: ""Collectively, the SNDG group will tighten linkages between planning and implementation, and allow us to be more agile in driving digital government and building Singapore as a smart nation.  Citizens, too, needed to be consulted early, said John Baekelmans, managing director and vice president of Belgium-based research institute IMEC, which specialised in nanotechnology and digital technologies. The company currently was helping the Belgium city of Antwerp with its smart city initiative, officially launched in January this year.  ""You need to work around a quadruple helix setup--comprising citizens, private companies, research organisations, and the public sector--where typically the citizen centric approach is the most important to consider [but] typically forgotten in a smart city environment,"" said Baekelmans, who was a speaker at the conference. ""One lesson we learnt is that citizens have to be consulted early. Trials can then be run based on the problems they want to solve.""  From there, data collected through IoT sensors could provide policy planners a picture of how to address the problems, he told ZDNet, adding that more datasets could be further collected to assess if improvements had been made.  ""It is crucial that citizens believe in a project [and] that their lives will be improved by it,"" he said. Putting in place the right customer panels for smart city applications and securing customer buy-in proved most challenging, he said, adding that once these use-cases were established, the rest would fall in place. He noted that technology selection should be the last piece of the puzzle, not the key driver of smart city projects.  ""Many smart city projects are top-down driven because you need the government to be able to effect changes to infrastructure. However, this also means that sometimes citizens are not consulted early enough and their needs not reflected,"" Baekelmans explained. ""Having that focus on citizens makes it more likely they will take up your digital service.""  He added that it remained challenging to seamlessly connect the different technologies since not all were open or based on industry standards. Security and privacy also were key considerations across any smart city framework, which meant IT vendors sometimes would have to be pushed to ensure compliance.  To better drive its smart nation trials forward, he suggested Singapore worked with its citizens in a ""living lab"" model and prepared to accept failure in order to understand why some technologies were rejected and learn from that. For instance, projects could fail because citizens felt the services were unnecessary or intruded on their privacy.  Balakrishnan also stressed the importance of cybersecurity, which he said was a key prerequisite of Singapore's smart nation efforts. ""Critical control systems must be protected even as we make them smart. We must ensure our digital identity framework and e-transactions are secure and robust,"" he said, adding that the government would continue to work with industry players and experts on this.  He also pointed to GovTech's collaboration with NUS, which would include establishing methods to bolster cybersecurity for government agencies.  Through such efforts and its smart nation initiatives, the Singapore government hoped to ensure the country was ready to embrace market changes ""from a position of strength"".  ""There is a digital revolution that is disrupting jobs and having a major impact on wages,"" the minister said. ""The [global] political disquiet is reflective of a revolution and the real choice for governments worldwide is whether you try to insulate, build walls, and avoid facing the reality of this revolution; or take the opposite approach to be open and prepare your people with the relevant skills and abilities so we can ride and surf the waves of this revolution.""",2017-03-29,"As technological advancements continue to impact societies, ...

31,36,"New buildings in Singapore may soon be inspected by a high-tech robot armed with laser scanners and cameras capable of spotting the tiniest cracks and defects.  SINGAPORE: New buildings in Singapore may soon be inspected by a high-tech robot armed with laser scanners and cameras capable of spotting the tiniest cracks and defects.  Named the ""Quality Inspection and Assessment Robot"" - or QuicaBot, it was invented by scientists from Nanyang Technological University, and co-developed with Singapores national industrial developer JTC and local start-up CtrlWorks for over a year.  The robot can move autonomously to scan a room in minutes, using an array of sensors and cameras that include:  1) A small laser scanner for navigation and mapping;  2) A large laser scanner to inspect walls' evenness and squareness;  3) An Inclinometer to check the evenness of the floor;  4) A thermal infrared camera to check for hollowness in tiles;  5) A small standard colour camera to detect cracks on walls.  Developers say their solution is more accurate, reliable and consistent than a fully manual inspection done by human inspectors with measurement tools like a spirit level and set square. For instance, inspections typically done by sampling points might miss possible errors which will not be overlooked by the robot as it can scan the entire space., according to its developers. Neither will the robots tire across the 36 hours of operation time they get on a single 2 hour charge.  Several of these robots could also work together, uploading 3D data of the scans to the cloud for a human operator to inspect critical and complex defects. They could also handle much of the routine, tedious inspection work and free up human inspectors to focus on areas that require more expertise and judgement to examine.  The key aim is to automate and speed up the building inspection process according to standards set by the Building and Construction Authority, said Project Leader from Nanyang Technological University's School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Assistant Prof Erdal Kayacan.  ""Visual inspection of a new building is an intensive effort that takes two inspectors, so we have designed a robot to assist a human inspector to do his job in about half the time, saving precious time and manpower,"" said Asst Prof Kayacan.    Having cleared small-scale lab testing, QuicaBot will be test-bedded at suitable locations within JTCs industrial developments like JTC Space @ Gul in the first quarter of 2017.

32,38,"Its a weekend, but these children are back at school.  Theyre not brooding over the extra class: in fact, quite the opposite. Theyre happily queuing up in a makeshift supermarket, smiling and bobbling about. Why is this exercise so fun for them The cashier happens to be a robot.  This is all part of a new scheme to prepare young Singaporean pre-schoolers for the future. The technology assists them with social development, and prepares them for a world of digital assistants and robotic colleagues. In five to 10 years, they might see a robot in the checkout counter, notes Adrian Lim, director of education at the Infocomm Media Development Authority.  IMDA is leading this new pilot project in partnership with the Softbank robotics company and Nanyang Technological University. GovInsider spoke with the key players to find out more.  Two Singaporean preschools have been trialling out Softbank robots since June. Two humanoid assistants  Pepper and Nao  teach geography, emotional skills, and recycling, amongst other lesson plans. For example, in one class a robot listens to a teacher read a story and gives emotional responses according to the plotline. Each trial class comprises roughly 12 to 16 students.  Why start in preschools Children aged five to six have underdeveloped cognitive capabilities, explains Chen I-Ming, Director of the Intelligent Systems Centre at NTU. At this younger age, I think its a good time to shape them. Once children are older than 10, they are less intrigued by robots.  This is, in fact, Lims second pilot using robots in Singaporean preschools. Last year, he launched the Playmaker scheme, where children used educational toys to learn vocabulary, logic, sequencing and navigation with educational toys. Robots assisted with the basics of the curriculum.  Now, he says, we have gone beyond introducing toy robots. This trial uses more advanced equipment for a broader range of tasks. Were interested in seeing how robots can support the teaching and learning process in the classroom.  How is Singapore doing this  Lims team approached the pilot methodically. First, they had teachers read books to the classes explaining to them what robots are. When you introduce any new technology, you cant just put the tech into the classroom without preparing the ground, Lim says. I dont think you can assume that kids know everything about robots, so it lies on the teachers to educate them.  Equally, teachers had to be given some technical understanding, and were consulted on potential lesson plans. At any point before the lessons were rolled out, everybody gave their input, Lim says.  Meanwhile, NTU provided academic expertise and looked to see how the two humanoid robots could be used appropriately. In each specific lesson, we utilised different robot capabilities, explains Chen. The reason why we can keep the kids excited, because everytime they see the robots, they can do something different, he adds.  There have been mixed results in the past five months. The teachers felt that robots in the classroom were a useful addition: There was higher retention, and a lot of kids look forward to coming to school, he says.  However, success is very much dependent on discipline in the classroom. Every child wants to rush toward the robot and touch it, he says. Teachers have to manage that instinct and ensure the class does not get overexcited.  Teachers should also have some technical understanding, he says. This indicates the future skills needed in the education profession. You need the teacher to be able to manage on the ground if the robot malfunctions. Lim recalls an instance when Peppers battery ran out: the teacher successfully turned it into a lesson on electricity and batteries.  The tech does currently have its flaws. For example, the robots only have a battery life span of 30 minutes  just enough to cover a class, Chen says; and it cannot recognise your voice in very noisy environments.  But for Lim and his colleagues, this pilot project is just the tip of the iceberg. Moving forward, you have really got to bring everybody together  the teachers and the industry players with the best tech, he says. Robots fascinate children, and they can provide support to teachers on a vital area of cognitive development.  Will the scheme soon be adapted by the masses Currently we are studying the findings, Lim says, consulting both NTU and Softbank on the best move forward. We think there is scope for us to deploy this to more pre-schools.  One characteristic of a Smart Nation might be the younger generation flocking to schools just to meet their robot classmate.

33,39,"An innovative robotic system that can clean building exteriors using water jets or give new coats of paint is now ready to serve customers in Singapore.  It is co-developed by local pioneer in automated controls and biometric contactless systems ELID Technology International and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), ranked 4th globally for Engineering & Technology in the recent Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World University Rankings by Subject 2017.  Named OutoBot, this patent-pending automation is locally built and will improve productivity while enhancing workplace safety. It needs only half the manpower to run and can work for longer hours as compared to manual methods.  For the washing or painting of a building faade, a team of five is usually required - two on the ground and roof top, with three cleaners or painters on the gondola.  Instead, Outobot requires only two workers - one operator on the ground and one as a safety officer.  It has a robotic arm equipped with a camera and a spray nozzle that can shoot high-pressure water jets to clean surfaces or to spray paint. No painters or cleaners are required to be on the system's specially built gondola.  ELID's first innovation in robotic automation was envisaged in response to the Housing & Development Board (HDB) call for proposals to automate the painting of external HDB building faades, so as to enhance worker safety and increase productivity.  Managing Director of ELID Technology International, Mr Dennis Lim, who first came up with an idea of the robotic system, said it would tackle productivity issues for painting buildings in line with Singapore's Smart Nation vision.  ""With Singapore's rapidly aging workforce, we need to find ways to enable our employees to continue contributing despite their advanced years,"" Mr Lim explained.  ""Using our new robot, we have shown that a labour-intensive job can transformed into one that can be easily done by an older worker, and at the same time eliminating the risk of employees having to work at heights,"" added Mr Lim.  Professor Chen I-Ming, Director of the NTU Robotic Research Centre who jointly led the development of OutoBot, said the project is an example of how the university leverages its engineering expertise to improve productivity, while enhancing worker safety.  ""Our aim is to make the cleaning and painting of high-rise buildings easier, safer and more cost-effective,"" explained Prof Chen, who teaches at NTU's School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. ""By using spray painting over conventional roller painting, our robot is also more precise and efficient, minimising waste and saving paint.""  ""To tackle Singapore's manpower challenges, NTU has a strong research focus on robotics, which is set to fill an important gap in the productivity and automation needs of the industry. We can now do more with less manpower.""  OutoBot comprises of a robotic arm with six-degrees of freedom mounted on a specially designed automated gondola and weighs under 500 kilogrammes.  Powered by a conventional power outlet, the robot can scan the exterior surface of a building using a camera and automatically plot the areas to spray paint or clean while avoiding the windows. It also gives a more consistent coat of paint as compared to the manual methods.  Apart from saving up to 50 per cent manpower requirements, it can speed up both the cleaning and painting process by about 30 per cent since it does not need a break. The automated system also minimises wastage, saving up to 20 per cent of paint.  To speed up the process at the same building, multiple systems can be deployed.  Next phase: Trials in industrial and residential areas  The made-in-Singapore OutoBot is now patent pending and has been put through its paces at an industrial building located at Ubi, in the eastern part of Singapore. It is now ready and will be deployed for an upcoming project over the next few months. It will also be tested on selected public housing blocks, in consultation with HDB. Through the trials, HDB will work with ELID to refine or customise the robot's design to better suit its building designs and facades.  ELID, together with NTU's innovation and enterprise arm NTUitive, are now in talks with other companies as well as government agencies to deploy the robot at other suitable commercial and residential properties.  A research-intensive public university, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore) has 33,500 undergraduate and postgraduate students in the colleges of Engineering, Business, Science, Humanities, Arts, & Social Sciences, and its Interdisciplinary Graduate School. It also has a medical school, the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, set up jointly with Imperial College London.

Today, the capabilities of robots have grown and humans and robots can almost work hand in hand. This may have resulted in the fear of robots for taking over jobs or the loss of the ""human touch"".  Against the backdrop of the tightening labour market and rising manpower costs, adopting robotic technology could potentially boost productivity, in addition to strengthening competitiveness and generating growth, whilst retaining staff employment. Studies have shown that robotics and automation have made a positive net effect on labour demand in the Europe and United States regions1.  Robotics has been identified as a growth sector in the international marketplace. Having a headstart in building competitive and differentiated robotics ecosystem may prove to be beneficial. According to the International Federation of Robotics Statistical Analysis and EU Roadmap 2013, the global robotics industry is projected to grow from US$20b today to US$80b by 2025.  China, already the global leader in the robotics sales market, will continue their quest at adopting robotics, targetting to achieve a robot density of 150 units by 2020. The Republic of Korea and Japan are hot on the heels of China2. Japan, already a known robotics powerhouse, has plans to triple its spending on intelligent machines to 2.4t yen by 20203. Robotics is also one of the pillars of Singapores future economy, with strong government support in the form of the National Robotics Programme.  The path to adopting robotics  starting with cobotisation   The path to adopting robotics has to be a well-planned one, and a good starting point would be to redesign work spaces to allow for an inclusive workplace where humans and robots can work together in a collaborative and mutually reinforcing way  cobotisation.  It is possible for a degree of artificial intelligence, perhaps a form of ambient intelligence, in robotic technologies to create effective engagements between man and machine. With the current advancements in sensor technology, visual analytics, and machine learning, robots are emerging as a viable working mate in both traditional settings and for new applications across industries.  At Tung Lok Group, it takes only two chefs to operate a cooking robot that can prepare up to 60kg of food. Smarter robotic arms are being developed to ensure safety and to minimise errors and wastage, monitored by technically-savvy human controllers. Small business owners such as toys and jewellery makers can also save time by automating some of their processes with automated 3D printers. The possibilities of robotics assisting humans are endless.  Getting ready for the change   Like any form of transformation, stakeholders would have to understand the business' stance and embrace the shift towards cobotisation. Business owners, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), must take the first step in understanding how robotics technologies can help their business stay competitive and look into the potential funding opportunities to ease them into the path of robotic technology adoption.  Small businesses can also participate in incubator programmes or training workshops established by industry leaders. ABB's Regional Robotics Packaging Application Hub features demo units to allow customers, partners, and ABB to run trials with actual products, assemble robotics systems, and run tests. Such innovation platforms benefit the emerging companies and are good best practices that could be adopted to fit their needs.  Before taking the plunge into the drive for robotics and automation, employers should start redesigning jobs and equip employees with new skills to prepare them for the shift towards cobotisation. They could also tap on funding and re-skilling opportunities available through the government or industry associations. In Singapore, we have the National Robotics Programme, which pledged $450m to help companies apply robotics and automation solutions.  Industry support is key   The transformation of the business should also be supported by the government agencies and industry associations.  Organisations such as SPRING Singapore has already taken steps to encourage more enterprises to adopt digital and automation solutions with its recently launched industry-specific roadmap. By partnering the Workforce Singapore to re-skill labour, the agencies will ensure a holistic transition, starting with the food services and retail industry.  The success of the first VendCaf, a food vending machine, is a prime example of the possibility of shifting towards robotics and automation. It not only requires 70% to 90% less manpower, but is also available 24/7 to consumers. There are already plans to launch more of such machines around the country.  1Study of Mannheim Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) and the University of Utrecht, 2016; and World Robotics Report 2016.

35,42,"SINGAPORE - Drivers headed to the Central Business District may have a robot as their next valet. By the end of the next year (2018), the redeveloped Robinson Towers will feature a new automated system that makes use of robots to park cars.  Guided by lasers, cameras, as well as markings on the ground, the robots will ferry cars - with a maximum weight of 2,600kg - from a drop-off point to the nearest available parking space.  Developed by engineering firm MHE-Demag, it is believed to be the first application of the technology in Singapore.  Unlike other mechanised parking systems the system does not require steel supporting structures or parking pallets, said MHE-Demag sales and markets regional director Klaus Schilling. Parking pallets are platforms on which cars are placed on before moving them.  ""No additional building provision is required for the system and it can be adapted into a conventional parking provision in any building development easily,"" he said.  The parking fee will be ""similar"" to other carparks, he added.  At CapitaGreen, across the road from Robinson Towers, it costs $3.10 per half hour to park between 7am and 6pm on weekdays.  Conventional mechanised parking systems - which use mechanical car lifters to carry a car to a storage space - can be found at several locations in Singapore, including three Housing Board car parks at Changi Village, Yishun and Bukit Panjang.  During peak periods, retrieving a car from these carparks can take about 10 to 15 minutes.  MHE-Demag's system offers ""relatively faster"" parking and retrieval times, said Mr Schilling, adding that the average time to retrieve a car - which is done using a mobile app - will be about two minutes.  The firm is also looking at introducing the technology at ""several other locations"", which it did not disclose. It has also started to introduce the technology in other countries in the region including Malaysia and Indonesia.  While the firm declined to say how much the system will cost, a similar system by Chinese firm Yee Fung Automation - introduced in Nanjing, China in December last year - is said to cost around $200,000.",2017-02-06,"Robinson Towers to feature robotic parking by 2018 ... firm MHE-Demag, it is believed to be the first application of the technology in Singapore.",Robinson Towers to feature robotic parking by 2018,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/robinson-towers-to-feature-robotic-parking-by-2018,3,1,4
36,43,"Nadine, a robot receptionist at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), is staring at the visitor in front of her. ""I remember you,"" she says. ""You were here last Saturday.""  The long-haired, uncannily human-looking robot pauses as her software runs through past interactions to figure out the most appropriate thing to say. Finally, she settles on: ""We talked about your job.""  At the National University of Singapore campus, a driverless cart attempts to navigate along a crowded walkway. When it senses a person in front of it, it stops; and as the crowd disperses, it inches forward, having learnt when to stop when an obstacle impedes its progress and when it is safe to move again.  These are two of the latest artificial intelligence (AI) projects that local researchers are working on as Singapore positions itself to grab a piece of the global market tipped to reach US$5.05 billion (S$6.8 billion) by 2020.  The revenue prediction by India- based research and consulting firm MarketsandMarkets was based on an expected rise in the adoption of AI in media and advertising, retail, finance and healthcare, growing from a market size of US$419.7 million in 2014.  The new wave of AI machines like Nadine has moved beyond traditional AI design, in which machines are given specific instructions to follow with no room for improvisation.  Rather, they tap into a subfield of AI, called machine learning, in which machines generate new outcomes for themselves after learning from previous outcomes.  ""Nadine could eventually act as a robotic caretaker for the sick or elderly,"" said NTU's Professor Nadia Thalmann, Nadine's creator.  Machine learning was thrust into the spotlight last month when a computer program, AlphaGo, beat one of the highest-ranking players in the world 4-1 in the ancient, complex board game of Go.  Such a feat was thought to be at least five years away, and would not have been possible without machine learning. It would have been impossible to code all the optimal moves into the software as the number of moves on the evolving board state can exceed the number of atoms in the universe.  However, AlphaGo's developer company, DeepMind, fed the software millions of Go games and had it play against itself, where it eventually learnt and developed a play style of its own. AlphaGo's success brought renewed interest in the capabilities of machine learning.  While both AI and machine learning are not new, they have become more accessible to software developers due to two recent factors: the rapid increase in computational power and the proliferation of big data.  ""These two advances in computing technology made it possible for computers to efficiently crunch large amounts of data to look for patterns, and to have a wide dataset to learn from,"" said Associate Professor Steven Hoi, an expert in machine learning from the Singapore Management University.  Consumers are seeing the applications of machine learning in the smart devices in their hands. Speech-recognition software like Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, for instance, make use of machine learning to comprehend a user's voice and the spoken instructions to the phone via a process called natural language processing.  Machine learning also underlies many of Google's services found in Android devices. Google Photos, for instance, uses machine learning to learn and tag objects in its gallery.  When a user searches for ""cats"", for example, the app is able to pick out photos with cats in them, having learnt how to identify such felines through millions of examples.  According to Professor Alfred Huan, executive director of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research's (A*Star) Institute of High Performance Computing, current capabilities of AI have reached near human-level performance in areas such as machine vision and speech recognition.  But while machine learning has enabled AI to leap ever closer to the ambitious goal of simulating human consciousness, experts say there is still a long way to go before the days of robotic superiority.  ""As impressive as these feats have been, machines are still nowhere near the intelligence of even a two-year-old child,"" said Prof Huan. ""We are still far away from any truly intelligent machine capable of replacing humans.""  Machine learning is a subset of the field of computer science known as artificial intelligence (AI), which seeks to simulate the workings of a human brain.  Machine learning is a form of programming, where the software improves its response after learning from previous responses, rather than following only scripted responses.  Nascent forms of machine learning first emerged some 20 years ago. The most modern form is ""deep learning"", which tries to model the neural networks of the human brain by identifying millions of patterns in large datasets to predict the next outcome.  It plays an important role in big data analytics and is currently the rage in machine-learning research, given the accessibility of big data and computational power.  Professor Lee Wee Sun, vice-dean of undergraduate studies at the National University of Singapore's School of Computing, says ""true"" AI is still far off in the future because there are four requirements for software before it can be deemed ""intelligent"": learning, planning, reasoning and knowledge representation.  So, while machines may currently be able to crunch large amounts of data and make accurate decisions, such as when to buy and sell in the stock market based on statistical predictions, the human mind may never be replaced in areas like artistic creativity or coming up with novel solutions to open-ended problems.",2016-04-19,"Nadine, a robot receptionist at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), is staring at the visitor in front of her.

37,44,"Your future home might be planned using virtual reality, built with a 3D printer and inspected by a robot for quality.  What may sound like a sci-fi movie could become reality in a few decades as Singapore ramps up its construction productivity and employs more efficient building methods.  Construction site productivity has grown by an average rate of 1.3 per cent per year since 2009 but there is still room for improvement, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong yesterday at the launch of the Singapore Construction Productivity Week at the Singapore Expo.  As such, the Government is adopting a string of measures to raise productivity growth to the national target of 3 per cent per year.  This comes amid a need to overcome manpower constraints as Singapore continues to develop and take on more construction projects, such as the upcoming Jurong Lake District and waterfront city at Tanjong Pagar, Mr Wong said.  The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has come up with a new road map that will see the industry develop, adapt and adopt technologies in areas such as robotics, 3D printing and prefabrication in factories.  Such methods, some of which are already in practice here, are expected to speed up the building process, rely on fewer workers and boost construction quality.  About 400 industry players, public agencies, institutes of higher learning and research institutions were consulted for this road map.  ""BCA will now study how we can support these different research priorities and give them a greater push,"" said Mr Wong.  BCA chief executive John Keung said the first step is to look for funding for such technologies, which are typically more expensive. But he is not too worried about cost.  Said Dr Keung: ""Once the industry is familiar with (such technologies), there will be economies of scale... and the cost will come down.""  Some of these technologies were on show yesterday at the event's BuildTech Asia exhibition, organised by Sphere Exhibits and hosted by BCA.  Nanyang Technological University's Singapore Centre for 3D Printing, for instance, showcased a 3D printer that can produce concrete structures.  The Government will also look at stipulating productivity outcomes, such as manpower savings, for future Government Land Sales (GLS) sites, but without mandating any specific technology.  Currently, the use of specific technologies, such as prefabricated pre-finished volumetric construction, has been mandated for selected GLS sites.  But the new requirement will allow ""more innovation and scope"" for firms bidding for the sites to come up with their own productive methods, said Dr Keung.",2016-10-18,"Nanyang Technological University's Singapore Centre for 3D Printing, for instance, showcased a 3D printer that can produce concrete ...",Use robot to check buildings in quality test?,http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/use-robot-check-buildings-quality-test,5,2,2
38,45,"Staff at the Park Avenue Rochester Hotel were introduced to two new colleagues last month - both made of metal and plastic and named Techi.  The 1.38m-tall robots deliver trolleys of duvets, pillow cases and towels at the 311-room hotel in Buona Vista - the first here to turn to robotics to cope with the labour shortage.  They navigate around the hotel, ride lifts on their own and have sensors that enable them to avoid obstacles such as walls and people.  Each robot uses driverless technology and can be controlled via a tablet to deliver items like toilet paper or extra pillows to guests. They can also be pre-programmed to perform routine tasks such as the daily delivery of clean linen to different floors.  Besides alleviating the labour shortage, having the robots do most of the manual work means that housekeeping staff have more time and energy to do other tasks, such as interacting with guests and inspecting rooms to ensure they are clean and well stocked, said the hotel's general manager Ryan Sun.  The hotel has only 23 of the 29 room attendants it needs. With the two robot housekeepers - which together can perform the job of three full-time employees in a year - the shortage is reduced to three workers.  Out to deliver trolley of linen A robot housekeeper helps to deliver a trolley of linen from the third-floor housekeeping room right up to the 23rd floor of the hotel. Here's how it does it. 1 Techi is pre-programmed to perform the task. It moves off from its charging bay and picks up a trolley of linen. The location of the trolley, placed there by housekeeping staff, is marked out by a yellow box on the ground. 2 Carrying the trolley, Techi takes the lift to the respective floor. It ""communicates"" with the lift using Wi-Fi. Sensors help the robot avoid obstacles. 3 Upon reaching the floor, Techi deposits the trolley at a designated spot outside the lift. 4 Techi re-enters the lift and returns to the housekeeping area to collect the next trolley of linen, and the cycle is repeated.  For linen attendant Tok Geok Lan, 47, managing the inventory is now less strenuous. But she had to pick up a new skill - learning how to use the tablet to control the robots.  "" The first time I used the tablet, I was confused,"" said Madam Tok, who joined the hotel eight months ago. ""But I attended training for one week on how to use it and, now, I think it's quite cool.""  The job scope may have changed, but staff salaries remain the same.  The pair of robots were partially funded by the Singapore Tourism Board's (STB) Business Improvement Fund. It is believed they each cost around $100,000 and were developed by an American company.  Mr Sun believes the Techi robots have the potential to perform other tasks, like helping guests who use wheelchairs to get around, delivering luggage or doing night patrols.  In two weeks, guests may meet a third new member of the team: another Techi that can deliver room- service orders on its own. This robot, which has eyes, giving it a friendlier appearance, is supported by funding from Spring Singapore.  The hotel may be the first to use robots here, but the practice has taken off overseas. In south-west Japan, one hotel has been staffed almost entirely by robots since July last year. And at Yotel hotel in New York City, a floor-to-ceiling robot arm called Yobot picks up luggage and stores it in lockers for guests.  Park Avenue Rochester's use of Techi may be a game changer here.  Ms Ong Huey Hong, STB's director of hotels and sector manpower, said it is in talks with other hotels that are interested in robotic solutions.  At a tourism sector conference in April, Minister for Trade and Industry (Industry) S.

The world's present situation today involves the imbalance between the population and source of food. Basfreported how robots and high-tech solutions contribute in the fight against world hunger in several ways.    Like Us on Facebook  Recent researchers showed a projection that there will be two billion people who will need to be fed in the next 33 years. This incurs a huge problem and food crisis, the reason why scientists today studies, how to end hunger in the next couple of years though it hasn't been started yet.    According to Science Daily, three years ago, the National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded $20 million grant for the University of Missouri for a paid study on how corn still maintains root growth despite the drought conditions. To support the study, the university engineers developed a robot that changed the scientist's ways.    Since that time, the robot contributed and made a difference in the study of crops in times of drought. Another great contribution of robot and high-tech solutions is the creation of green walls in cities. Green walls aim the use of vertical spaces in actual farming such as the side of a building or apartments.    Founder and President of the Earth Policy Institute, Lester R. Brown, believes that ""Food is the new oil, a land is a new gold."" Because of this, planting was conceptualized to be on Sky Greens, a nine-meter-high planting shelves used for cabbage, spinach, and lettuce. This vertical farming method was proven effective in Singapore and Japan factories.    Additionally, with the aid of a tablet or smartphone, farming becomes modernized. The apps help in diagnosing crop diseases so that it can be further sustained. There will also be camera-assisted sprayers that save time and precisely targets the leaves of plants making it more efficient.

42,49,"From waiting tables to picking out medicine, robots are transforming the way people work. NTU researchers are even perfecting a robot that tutors primary school children.  SINGAPORE: More companies are looking to using robots to take over tasks traditionally performed by workers. This can help improve productivity and address the issue of manpower shortage.  Researchers from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have envisioned that in schools of the future, robots will be able to guide children in their lessons, so that teachers will have more time to observe students behaviour and identify their needs.  ""Imagine we are putting a more structured curriculum into the robot to help tutor the lower primary school kids, like those in P1, P2 - a companion robot to help them go through their curriculum, explained Dr Chen I-Ming, director of NTUs Robotics Research Centre.  The researchers have come up with a prototype that it has tested in some kindergartens. The project is funded by the Singapore Millennium Fund, a foundation supported by Temasek Trust.  Children would be able to control the movements of the robots using sensors. Teachers can also benefit, by doing voice recordings of stories using the robots and playing them back to the students.    For teachers, it also means picking up a new skill. ""I have some problems because I'm not very familiar (with it), said Ms Leela Chua, a teacher with Youth Progress Singapore. Teachers should be open. It's lifelong learning - we should always look forward to something new, something up to date.""  Dr Chen said that since 2013, more companies have shown an interest in robotics, and have approached the university to enquire about collaborations.    ""It's actually different from sector to sector. If you are in manufacturing sectors, their main goal is to improve productivity. If it's anything that really improves productivity, they will take it up immediately, said Dr Chen. But for other social or educational types of robots, they need to go through a lengthy case study, or test-bedding and also prove the results. That will probably take a bit much longer. You still need probably two to three years at least.    Robot waiter Techi can work long hours, deliver food and drinks to customers and even take the lift to hand over toiletries to hotel guests. The company behind the robot said more than 10 firms will be using it from March.    ""Our aim is to replace the repeated, tiring jobs for human beings, so that they can concentrate more on the productive work, said Techmetics chairman and technical director Mathan Muthupillai. If you talk about the F&B side, waiters are spending more time on actually taking the items and delivering them to the table - that work can be actually taken care of by the robot.    Mr Neelendra Jain, founder and CEO of food and beverage solutions provider The Happy Roots, said with non-skilled tasks being diverted to robots, staff will be able to focus on work which would require their skills.    At KK Womens and Childrens Hospital, a robotic bottle-dispensing system was rolled out in 2015. It can load, pick, assemble and label medicine bottles. Before the medicine is dispensed to patients, pharmacy staff will perform an additional round of checks.  This replaces many of the manual tasks involved, saving around 8,760 man-hours a year. Previously, staff had to manually pick, pack, assemble, barcode, and track expiry dates and batch numbers, across various types of bottled medication.    At first, me and my colleagues were a bit apprehensive about operating the machines as we didn't know what to expect, whether the machines will be beneficial for us, said Ms Hamidah Rahmat, a senior pharmacy technician at KKH.

43,50,"EXCLUSIVE: Singapore researchers are testing robotic swans that could provide essential, highly advanced water testing in reservoirs around the country and the world.  SINGAPORE: Floating on the surface of Pandan Reservoir in Singapores south west are what researchers hope will be the future of cheap, real-time water quality testing.  Developed by a team at the National University of Singapore (NUS), in conjunction with the national water agency PUB, the NUSwan utilises advanced water monitoring technology, fitted into the shell that closely resembles a living, breathing bird.  We started with a number of smaller bird models, before we decided on the swan. Its just the right size, said Assistant Professor Mandar Chitre, one of the projects lead researchers. If you look at it in the environment, it just looks like a swan swimming around.  A small team at the NUS Environmental Research Institute, working with the Tropical Marine Science Institute, initially conceptualised the robot back in 2010 but only began their first series of test bedding last year.  The aim is to mobilise the robotic swans to monitor different physical and biological compounds in fresh water, including pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and chlorophyll, which are common indicators used to determine if there are problems in a water source.  At present, water authorities face the logistical challenge of physically having to collect samples from large bodies of water, normally using a boat. It is an approach that requires time and manpower and restricts the speed at which officials can act in the case of an outbreak or a contamination.  It would be expensive to do similar monitoring manually or using AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), said Asst Prof Chitre. Hence to reduce reliance on manpower and increase efficiency in water quality monitoring, we are constantly looking into developing new technology with improved capabilities.  Scientifically, the NUSwan test drives a new paradigm of freshwater monitoring, one that is persistent and interactive, and is potentially able to sample the dynamics of water quality over space and time at improved resolution at an affordable cost, he added.  The swans work by trawling particular areas of interest in a water body and wirelessly sending back data through cloud computing. Programmers will be able to remotely control the robots, but the aim is to ensure they are as autonomous as possible, requiring just basic monitoring and operation, which can happen from anywhere with an internet connection.  The researchers said the swans navigation is more advanced than an automatic vacuum cleaner for instance, which can avoid obstacles but cannot tell where it has already travelled. The SWAN uses GPS to ensure it does not duplicate its monitoring efforts, unless programmed to.  They are durable enough such that even if a recreational water user such as a kayaker, or even a small boat, hits the swan, it will not be damaged, according to the teams behind the technology.  They believe they are at just the tip of realising the potential of this system and have designed the NUSwan to be adaptable to various environmental challenges that may arise.  The NUSwan platform is designed to be extendable  new sensors and actuators can be added on demand to increase its sensing capability, said Mr Koay Teong Beng, one of the other leading researchers on the project.  Already the team is collaborating with other university researchers to combine technologies and stretch the swans to their technological limits.  This includes a highly sensitive freshwater phosphate sensor, which is being developed independently by a separate NUS team. Phosphates are key nutrients in the development of blue-green algal blooms, which can be devastating for water sources.  There is a hope that technology such as the phosphate sensor could be mobilised by the NUSwan, and provide a real-world alarm system to the threat of algal blooms, a common problem encountered in more polluted waterways as a result of fertilisers, sewerage and domestic waste.  Earlier this year, a proliferation of algal blooms in oxygen-depleted, bacteria-rich waters caused thousands of fish to die. While the phosphate sensor has only been tested in fresh water, it is this kind of scenario that it is designed to help prevent.  Phosphate detection was lacking; phosphate sensors are not available in the market, said Lanry Yung, Associate Professor of Chemical and Bio-molecule Engineering . The prototype is finished. Now we are trying to do automation and collaboration with the NUSwan team to work on hardware.  Salt complicates the process, but nonetheless its something to look into at the next stage, he said.  The NUSwan has received interest from water authorities across the region, particularly in China where water pollution is a pressing issue and where the system will be tested on several rivers in the south of the country. That could potentially see the robotic swans floating on some of the worlds largest water reservoirs in the near future.  We see the potential of having NUSwans deployed in urban freshwater bodies and coastal water beyond Singapore.

The next two higher-level courses, each to run for five days, will be launched in March, with another two to follow later.  Mr Gilbert Tan, chief executive of the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i), urged firms and industries to prepare for the future and adopt more advanced technology in manufacturing. His institute has signed an agreement with Race and Workforce Singapore to develop skills training and support employers in staff development.  Race will also team up with the Singapore Precision Engineering and Technology Association and e2i, to help its members learn about technology and buy more of it.  Yesterday, Race held a session on it for about 40 company officials.  ASTech managing director Mun Kok Woh, whose robotics solutions company employs 12 people, said it is costly for his more experienced staff to stop work to train new hires. ""If someone can teach them the basic know-how, that would help.

45,52,"With Singapore's rapidly-ageing population, there will be more seniors needing care in future, but not enough carers to do the job.  This is why hospitals are turning to robots and other assistive technology to ease the burden on the manpower-strapped sector.  Instead of a nurse checking every 15 minutes for six hours, to see if a patient who has had a cathether inserted is bleeding, a special blood-sensitive ""bandage"" can do the job, freeing the nurse for six hours of more fulfilling work.  A robot, not a therapist, can help recovering stroke patients exercise; another can keep early stage dementia patients occupied and alert them to take their medicine, or to call for a helper when it senses that they are struggling to get up.  Call it Changi General Hospital's answer to the labour crunch. This technology can become mainstream within the next few years.     President Tony Tan looks at a Interactive Robot for Telemedicine during the opening of the new Integrated Building at Changi General Hospital on 23 July, 2015.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG     Dr Chionh Chang Yin, who heads Renal Medicine at CGH, plans to trial the blood-sensitive bandages designed by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) later this year.  If it works as well as expected, it can be used not only for dialysis patients, but also heart patients who have had a stent put in, or had to do an angiogram to check the heart.  Bleeding from the puncture hole is rare, said Dr Chionh, but should it happen, a patient can bleed to death if not treated imediately. The SUTD device can tell blood from other fluids, and will set off an alarm if it senses one millilitre of blood.     Health Minister Gan Kim Yong looks at a HOSPI Autonomous Delivery Robot during the opening of the new Integrated Building at Changi General Hospital on 23 July, 2015.ST PHOTO: MARK CHEONG     The idea for the Centre for Healthcare Assitive and Robotics Technology (Chart), started early last year and launched by President Tony Tan on Thursday (July 23), was triggered by the visit of a team from Japan in 2012 wanting to know if there was a market for such products.  Dr Lee Chien Earn, CGH's Chief Executive Officer, said some technology might be great, but not what patients or hospitals want. So CGH decided to work with industry on what it needs instead.  ""It's better to create solutions to meet needs,"" he said. ""The user must be involved from the start.""  The technology does not have to be new, he said. It can be something used in other industries that can be adapted to healthcare needs.  Examples that are now being tweaked to fit healthcare settings include automated guided vehicles (AGV) used in warehouses. The unit can carry shelves holding food, linen or files, or move heavy items like beds. All it needs is a map of the hospital to find its way around.  The idea is to ""take the manual out of healthcare"", said Chart's director Ms Selina Seah, adding that it is increasingly hard to find people to fill jobs like porters.  A team from the Nanyang Technological University took six months to convert an industrial robotic arm to pick and pack a range of objects, including fragile items.  Ms Seah said the robot arm can work non-stop and do the job without mistakes, unlike people who get tired and could become careless.  Dr Tan said Chart provides a platform for research institutes, companies and healthcare practitioners to collaborate in the development of new, impactful healthcare delivery solutions.  He revealed that Chart will be part of the National Robotics Programme. The Government will release details later this year of this multi-agency initiative to test-bed robotic technologies across various sectors, he said.

46,53,"When she got married 10 years ago, Ms Pranoti Nagarkar Israni, co-founder of automatic roti- maker Rotimatic, would painstakingly make chapati, an Indian flat bread, for her husband.  The time-consuming and tedious task of kneading the dough and slaving behind the stove every day got her thinking of developing an automatic roti-maker.  As it turned out, she and her husband Rishi Israni, both 34 and graduates from the National University of Singapore, were perfectly suited to the task.  Ms Nagarkar is a mechanical engineer, while Mr Rishi is a computer science graduate who ran his own mobile security company. So, she took charge of figuring out the mechanics of the roti-maker, while he figured out the software technology.  The India-born Singapore citizens, who have a three-year-old son, started Zimplistic in 2008. Eight years later, the company's first and only product, the Rotimatic, has finally been shipped to its first batch of customers. They had placed orders in 2014.  The robotic roti-maker received special mention in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech last Sunday.  1. Plug in the Rotimatic and switch it on. It takes three to four minutes to heat up. Meanwhile, fill the compartments with flour, oil and water. 2. On the touchscreen, select the number of roti required, the thickness, roast level and amount of oil (one or two drops for each roti). Press the start button. 3. The machine will start to churn out a ball of dough from the flour, oil and water. If the dough is not formed properly, an error message will appear and the dough can be removed by opening the side door to the machine. The dough-making will then resume. 4. Once the dough is formed, a lever pushes it onto a hot pan to cook. The dough is flattened into a disc and it puffs up while cooking . When the first roti is being cooked, the machine will start kneading the dough for the next one. 5. Once cooked, the roti is pushed out onto the attached (removable) tray. It is best eaten hot with curry, as a wrap with filling or as a dessert crepe. 6. The machine can make up to 20 roti in less than 30 minutes. If there is not enough flour, water or oil in the containers, the machine will prompt the user to add more ingredients. 7. To clean the Rotimatic, the ingredient containers and parts used for the kneading of the dough can be removed for washing. When cool, the hot pan (not removable) can be wiped clean.  Watch how the Rotimatic works at str.sg/4cGh  When speaking on promoting entrepreneurship, he cited it as one of the success stories from start-up hot spot Block 71 in Ayer Rajah Crescent. It is run by the JTC Corporation and is part of the JTC LaunchPad programme, which provides a nurturing environment for start-ups.  Zimplistic's office is now located in Commonwealth Lane.  The machine can make up to 20 cooked roti in under 30 minutes, using only whole wheat flour, oil and water.  Users select the thickness of the roti, roast level, amount of oil and number of roti required, and press a button to start the process.  Each Rotimatic is priced at US$999 (S$1,351). It is made in Malaysia, weighs 18kg and is about the size of a microwave oven.  Pre-orders for the next batch of machines are likely to open next month, says Ms Nagarkar, but deliveries may be made only in the first quarter of next year, as the company is now shipping machines to customers in the United States who pre-ordered them.  Shipment has been completed for the ""few hundred"" Singapore orders.  Within five days of launching pre-orders in the US and Singapore in June 2014, the company received more than 8,000 orders.  Ms Nagarkar says customers were updated via e-mail about the progress and were allowed to request refunds at any time. Seven per cent of customers who preordered asked for refunds, she adds.  On the challenges faced at the beginning, she says: ""Many people thought the Rotimatic was a crazy idea. Building a team and getting investors were tough. We needed to raise money and credibility.""  To build buzz, she took part in the Start-Up @Singapore Business Plan Competition in 2009 and won the top prize of $40,000 for the Rotimatic.  The following year, the company got its first seed funding of US$400,000 from angel investors. In 2012, Zimplistic received US$3 million from private investors and, in July last year, another US$11.5 million of funding was received from venture capital firm NSI Ventures and global engineering giant Robert Bosch GMbH.  Calling the eight years it took to perfect the Rotimatic a ""humbling experience"", she says: ""We took time to stabilise the system, to make sure every roti is consistent. For the past two years, we would make 2,000 roti daily in the office, to test the reliability of the machine.""  Of course, the Rotimatic is not perfect. Currently, it can work with only one brand of flour - Aashirvaad whole wheat flour - which can be bought online at www.myonlinegroceries.com. It costs $2 for a 1kg bag.  If the ball of dough rolled out is not ""perfect"", the machine will alert users to discard the dough before churning out another batch.  Ms Nagarkar says: ""For the first batch of machines that we have sent out, perhaps the first five roti may not be great. It is also a learning path for the machine.""  There are plans to upgrade the software so users can make other types of flat breads and add ingredients such as herbs and spices to the dough.  The smart flat bread-maker is programmed to enable software upgrades over the cloud and remote troubleshooting via an app.  This will also allow users to get recipes from Zimplistic's in-house chef, who was initially hired to provide meals for the 85 office staff. The chef now helps in product development.  Ms Nagarkar hopes to sell the Rotimatic to other countries such as India, as well as in the Middle East and Britain.  The product will be sold exclusively online - she has no plans to sell it in supermarkets or department stores. However, she does not rule out doing product demonstrations for consumers to understand how the machine works.  On the hefty price tag, she says the Rotimatic - with its smart functions and cooking abilities - is unlike other kitchen appliances.  She says: ""The making of roti - it's the same amount of hassle and pain required when washing clothes with your hands. When you have a washing machine, you realise how much time it saves you.  ""Rotimatic is similar, in terms of saving you time and tedious labour. And you get a cooked product at the end of it.""

49,57,"SINGAPORE - The National Robotics Programme, which was announced last year (2015), will be scaled up this year with the announcement of more than $450 million to support it over the next three years.  Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat made the announcement in his Budget speech on Wednesday (March 24) as he spoke about industry-level transformation.  Developing and deploying new technologies to solve problems that are relevant for the entire industry can drive industry-level transformation, he said.  Robotics technology can enable us to work more effectively in a tight labour market, and can also create more high value-added jobs, he added.  Keeping that in view, the ministry will work with solution providers to offer packaged solutions to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) at a reasonable cost.  Robotics and automation technology can be applied widely to transform sectors such as healthcare, construction, manufacturing and logistics.  Using the example of robotics in the healthcare industry, Mr Heng said the technology is being used in pharmacies in hospitals to pick medication accurately and quickly, which frees up time for staff to give advice on the medication.  Autonomous transporters are also being used to move supplies efficiently in hospitals.

50,58,"The robot, PictoBot, can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.  SINGAPORE: A spray-painting robot could halve the number of workers needed to paint walls at industrial developments, do the job 25 per cent faster and improve safety, announced Nanyang Technological University (NTU), JTC and the National Research Foundation (NRF) on Wednesday (Oct 26).  Industrial buildings come with high ceilings to accommodate bulky equipment and materials. Currently, the conventional method for spray painting requires a team of two painters using a scissor lift to reach the high ceilings.  ""Working at such heights exposes painters to various safety risks,"" they said.  In comparison, the 1.5-tonne PictoBot needs only one human supervisor on ground level. Using its optical camera and laser scanner, the robot can navigate and paint walls up to 10 metres high with its robotic arm.  PictoBot can paint a wall 90 square metres in size in an hour, whereas it would take a team of two painters more than 1.5 hours to do the same job.     It can also work four hours on one battery charge, giving walls an even coat of paint that matches industry standards. It can even operate in the dark, the organisations added.  These features allow the robot to paint continuously day or night, improving efficiency and freeing up manpower.  Developed in a year at NTU's Robotic Research Centre, the project is supported under NRF's Test-Bedding and Demonstration of Innovative Research funding initiative which aims to use Government-led demand efforts to demonstrate feasibility of innovative technologies and catalyse adoption by private sectors.  To ensure that PictoBot meets industry standards, its developers said it will be tested at industrial developments such as JTC Space @ Gul.  JTC Director of Innovation Programme Office and Corporate Planning Anil Das said that such robotic solutions help improve the productivity of the construction industry.  ""Developers can go to market a lot faster and industry players can continue with us to develop even more innovative solutions to alleviate some of the construction productivity challenges that we face today,"" he said.  As for how jobs in the future will be affected by autonomous robots, NTU Robotic Research Centre Director Professor Chen I-Ming said workers will be able to upgrade their skills and will be trained to operate the machines.

52,60,"Robots may be good at following instructions, but could they also be our companions and caregivers  AsianScientist (Jan. 3, 2017) - By Feng Zengkun - Head to Singapores Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and you might be able to spot Nadine, a cyberhuman with soft skin, brunette hair, and a ready smile. Touted as the worlds most life-like robot, she can not only remember your name and past conversations, but also strike up a chat and even empathize with your troubles.  Over the past few years, scientists across Asia have unveiled a series of humanoid robots that could one day help to look after our children, keep grandma and grandpa company and give directions to people in public spaces such as museums and malls. Aside from Nadine, there is also JiaJia, a female robot created by Chinese researchers, and Geminoid, a male robot developed by renowned Japanese roboticist Hiroshi Ishiguro (What Humanoids Can Teach Us About Being Human).  These social robotsso-called because they are meant to interact with peoplecould help to alleviate the lack of caregivers in aging societies such as Singapore, Japan, China and South Korea, and their limitless patience could also be useful in therapy for children with learning problems and the elderly who suffer from dementia.  Although the need is undoubtedly great, are robots currently up to the task And even if they were, should machines replace human companions and caregivers      The complexity of a chat  Not unlike people, robots rely on sensors, such as cameras for eyes and microphones for ears, to recognize images and sounds, and then process the information to react accordingly. However, while they can be programmed to learn to identify people, objects and words, they remain ill-equipped to detect nuances in human interactions, which range from sarcasm to passive-aggressiveness and subtext.  Most people instinctively pick up on a multitude of subtle cues, such as body language, facial expressions and tone of voice, to determine other peoples moods and feelings. Robots are currently unable to replicate such seamless collection and integration of cues, which means that they are usually unable to tell if a person is being sarcastic or sincere.  There are other technical challenges. Like people, robots microphone-ears can be distracted by surrounding noises, and their camera-eyes derailed by bad lighting, occlusion and environmental obstructions, for example, if it is raining. While people are good at recognizing other people in unusual positionssuch as elderly people who are hunched overrobots might be flummoxed by such variations.  Also, while researchers have made several achievements in physical human-to-robot interactions, the settings of the investigated scenarios are still too simplesuch as just shaking handsto be realistic enough for real-world applications, said other scientists. Robots need more physical and emotional intelligence if they are to care for the elderly or children.      Becoming human  Research institutes and companies across Asia are looking into solutions for these challenges. One widely-used method is to collect massive amounts of data and use it to teach the robots.  One success story so far is Xiaoice, an artificially-intelligent software program designed by Microsofts Applications and Services Group East Asia to chat with people online (The AI Spring Is Coming). Modeled after the persona of a 17-year-old Chinese girl, Xiaoice has had more than ten billion conversations with people, with many of them not realizing she wasnt human until ten minutes into the chat, according to her creators.  But big data is no silver bullet. When Microsoft launched a similar chatbot called Tay in March 2016, she had to be taken down in just 16 hours, having evolved into an expletive and hate-spewing Twitter stream. Unlike Xiaoice, Tay had somehow not managed to learn the social rules of engagement from its analysis of Twitter data. Instead, she merely reflected the very worst of human behavior, becoming like the racist trolls that haunt the underbelly of the internet.  All this suggests that robots need some guidance in their journey to becoming more human. In 2007, the government of South Korea said that it was drawing up a Robot Ethics Charter to prevent social ills from the use of robots. While there have been no updates, researchers said at the time that it could include guidelines that robots must not deceive or hurt people, and that their users personal details and other sensitive information must be kept confidential.  Nonetheless, ATR laboratories Kanda is optimistic that the technological challenges and ethical concerns can be resolved, and that similar issues had been raised with existing technologies such as smartphones and computers.

53,61,"A new robot that can paint faster than humans will soon be brushing its way across industrial buildings here, and may even roll into other spaces if ongoing tests take off.  The PictoBot, invented by scientists from the Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) Robotic Research Centre, can spray-paint high interior walls 25 per cent faster than two workers.  For instance, a 90 sq m wall usually takes over 90 minutes for two men to spray-paint. But the robot, which weighs 1,500kg when fully loaded with paint and 12 batteries, can do the job within an hour.  The PictoBot, named after pictor, the Latin word for painter, can house 120 litres of paint before it is manually refilled.  Using an optical camera and laser, it can automatically scan its surroundings and navigate walls up to 10m high with its six-axis robotic arm and automated jack-up platform. The machine, which measures 2m by 2m by 3.5m, was developed in a year by JTC Corporation and local start-up Aitech Robotics and Automation.  The National Research Foundation, which supported the project through its Test Bedding and Demonstration of Innovative Research funding initiative, did not reveal the robot's cost. But it said funding of up to $1 million is provided for each project under the initiative.  Mr Anil Das, director of JTC's innovation programme office and corporate planning, said the robot helps to mitigate risks of painting at height, as many industrial buildings have high ceilings to house bulky equipment and materials.  Currently, painting these walls requires at least two painters in a scissor lift. The PictoBot, which can run for four hours on one battery charge, requires only one human supervisor and can even operate in the dark.  The principal investigator of the project, Professor Chen I-Ming, director of the NTU Robotic Research Centre, said the PictoBot has a higher quality of finish compared with current painting methods.  ""Painting large industrial spaces is repetitive, labour intensive and time-consuming,"" said Prof Chen. ""The autonomous behaviour also means that a single operator can handle multiple robots and refill their paint reservoirs.""  Prof Chen's team will continue to look at improving the robot, such as enabling it to replace its own paint cans and paint in more than one colour. He added that they are considering rolling out the use of the robot to non-industrial buildings, although more testing is needed in the meantime.

54,62,"Singaporeans were least comfortable with integrating artificial intelligence in education but were more acceptable to it being used in household controls, according to a study by Blackbox Research.  SINGAPORE: Fancy having a robot teach your kids, or having them use educational tools integrated with artificial intelligence (AI)  Just over four in 10 Singaporeans, or 43 per cent, polled by Blackbox Research were keen on integrating AI in their children's education. This was below the regional average of 58 per cent and just above Indonesia at 40 per cent - the lowest among the five Asian countries surveyed. Japan, China and South Korea were the other three countries surveyed.  Blackbox surveyed 3,213 adult respondents across the five countries between Oct 12 and 23 last year.  Similarly for transport, Singaporeans and Indonesians showed the most resistance towards AI integration. According to the survey, 49 per cent of Singaporeans and 47 per cent of Indonesians polled said they were comfortable with this, below the regional average of 66 per cent. China topped the category at 76 per cent.    ""Surprisingly for a country playing host to the worlds first self-driving taxis, less than half of Singaporeans are comfortable with AI integration in their transport, suggesting a decrease in trust in self-automated transport post Julys runaway LRT incident,"" the survey report said.  On Jul 28 last year, a fault on an LRT train's antenna caused the train to skip three stations along the Bukit Panjang LRT line.  The country is continuing its push in this area though, loosening up regulations to foster innovation, particularly in the autonomous vehicle arena.    On Tuesday, Parliament passed the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill, which includes a regulatory sandbox allowing the Transport Minister to create new rules that can place time and space limits on the AV trials, set standards for the design of the AV equipment and impose requirements to share data from the trials, among others.  When it comes to having AI integrated with homes, however, Singaporeans were more receptive, the survey found.  A total of 74 per cent of Singapore respondents would be willing to have the technology in their house, in line with the regional average of 80 per cent. China, again, led the way with 87 per cent while South Korea, home to Samsung and its range of AI-integrated household control technology, followed at 79 per cent.  Almost nine in 10 Chinese, or 88 per cent, would also allow a robot to do their household chores, followed by Japan at 76 per cent and South Korea at 75 per cent. Singapore and Indonesia were at 67 per cent, the survey showed.  A high level of acceptance for AI tech was seen for the supermarkets category, too, with 73 per cent of Singaporeans indicating their acceptance.  ""Most of Asia seems ready to accept AI into their retail shopping lives, especially in supermarkets where self-checkout systems are becoming an everyday norm,"" the survey report said.  Overall, just under four in five Asians in the countries polled were comfortable with AI entering their everyday lives, with China leading the way in terms of adopting it, Blackbox found.  ""The survey findings show that the potential for artificial intelligence in Asia is enormous. Theoretically, Asians have always been quick adaptors of new technology, and it would seem that the region is now poised to lead the rest of the world in embracing even higher forms of technology,"" it said.",2017-02-07,"SINGAPORE: Fancy having a robot teach your kids, or having them ... of AI-integrated household control technology, followed at 79 per cent.","Singaporeans not comfortable with robot-led teaching, transport ...",http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singaporeans-not-comfortable-with-robot-led-teaching-transport/3501194.html,1,8,0
55,63,"A new report from the International Bar Association has outlined the risks and rewards of artificial intelligence (AI), which while bordering on scaremongering also makes some good points, writes Telecoms.com (Banking Technologys sister publication).  The report highlights there is likely to be a widening gap between the worlds richest and poorest nations. Countries like China or Thailand have grown through the last few years partly due to the difference in labour costs. Primary (mining, for example) and secondary (manufacturing) industries have been moved offshore because of the cost benefit, though robotisation on a mass scale would make this transition redundant.  The report highlights: While one production working hour costs the German automotive industry more than 40, the use of a robot costs between 5 and 8 per hour. A production robot is thus cheaper than a worker in China is. A further aspect is that a robot cannot become ill, have children or go on strike and is not entitled to annual leave.  This is a very real threat which could lead to mass unemployment, and migration towards more affluent regions of the world. The report deems 70% of employment in countries like India or Thailand under threat, which could very feasibly lead to unprecedented levels of migration.  On the other end of the scale, countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea in Asia, or the Scandinavians in Europe have been working to find digital solutions for complex issues for a long time. Here, only 6% of the population is under threat of unemployment. Elsewhere, in countries like the UK, the cost effectiveness of robots in manufacturing could see such industries return. The basic roles will be performed by the robots themselves, though there will be new jobs created with the return of smart factories.  The education system will also be called into question. This is another highly valid point as it challenges the basic concept of education; smarter is better. With the introduction of more automated workloads, certain roles which are highly valued in todays society will come under threat. An accountant, for instance, could in theory become redundant.  That said, money is the most important factor in todays world. Humans are unlikely to hand over control of the most important certainty in society at any point in the foreseeable future. AI will become an assistant, however there will be a human element in control for a long-time.  This doesnt protect manufacturing or artistic crafting jobs however, though one suggestion made by the authors is to create a made by human label. In the same way free-range foods or ethically sourced products are marketed today, a made by human product range could well capture the interest of certain demographics. But this will only be a diversionary tactic; the transition will continue to role on as it has with cheaper products in the super market today.  What the report doesnt address is the human element. The tone and approach is typical for a lawyer; its accurate, functional and devoid of emotion or human connection. While artificial intelligence is progressing at an astonishing rate, the development of the technology will not dictate mass market usage, the acceptance of the mass market will.  Over the last couple of months we have seen small incremental introductions of artificial intelligence to the world of technology. Minor examples, such as Facebooks auto-tagging feature, normalise AI in the eyes of the consumer to such a degree the definition of what AI is becomes blurred. Most people dont realise AI plays a notable role in their lives already, but this transition will be a lengthy one.  As humans we need someone to blame when something goes wrong, as most of the time we are unable to hold ourselves accountable. Machines do not accept blame or sympathise with consequence however. Can you sue a machine In countries where litigation is common, this could be a huge point of resistance. Without the ability to place blame, humans would lose an element of control, and quite frankly, not many people would be prepared to do that.  So yes, primary and secondary industries around the world are under threat, but it magnitude of change in human mentality to accept AI in tertiary industries on a fundamental and mass-scale is huge. Were not there yet.  Lawyers could be placed in a similar bracket to consultants; they find problems and create work for themselves. So yes, eventually tertiary jobs will be handed over to AI, but lets put the scaremongering into a 2017 perspective; theres no need to panic just yet.",2017-04-04,"A production robot is thus cheaper than a worker in China is. ...

56,65,"SHENZHEN (CHINA DAILY/ASIA NEWS NETWORK) - A man was hurt after an educational robot smashed a window at a technology fair and he was cut by the glass.  While some called it an ""attack"" on the visitor at the China Hi-tech Fair (CHTF) 2016 on Thursday (Nov 17), the accident was caused by misoperation of the robot by a staff member, the organising committee of CHTF said on Friday.  The visitor was reportedly injured after a robot named ""Xiaopang"" (meaning ""Fatty"") ran into a window, smashing it into pieces.  The visitor's leg was wounded by broken glass and he was taken to Peking University Shenzhen Hospital in an ambulance. He later went home after receiving a few stitches.  The accident took place at about 2pm when the exhibitor, Spreadview Century, a Shenzhen high-tech enterprise, was demonstrating the robot to visitors.  In a statement, the fair's organising committee said the employee mistakenly hit the ""forward"" button, instead of the ""reverse"" one, leading to the accident.  An exhibitor surnamed Zhang whose booth is located near the accident site told China Daily that he heard a loud noise when the accident happened and saw many people gathering at the site.  The robot had been withdrawn from the site by Friday afternoon.  The robot, produced by Beijing robot company Evolver, was developed for children aged between four and 12 years old for educational use, according to media reports.  It made its debut in November 2015 at the World Robot Conference.  CHTF, known as China's biggest and most influential technology show, is an annual event during which enterprises and organisations from all over the world share and trade their latest technologies and products.

57,66,"Smart technology will ""be an enabler"" to help SMEs in the sector redesign workflow processes, and in turn rely less on manpower, IDA and WDA said.  SINGAPORE: Small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the cleaning sector were introduced to automated smart technology as part of a ""Learning Journey"" event on Tuesday (Apr 26) organised by the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA), Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) and Marina Bay Sands (MBS).    Smart technology will ""be an enabler"" to help SMEs in the sector redesign workflow processes, and in turn rely less on manpower, IDA and WDA said. Under the Learning Journey, cleaners will also get the opportunity to train with smart technology machines and learn to become technicians.  The project is supported under the Lean Enterprise Development scheme, which was launched in October 2015 by the Ministry of Manpower and other sectoral agencies to help SMEs transform and grow in a manpower-lean landscape.  The event on Tuesday showcased various automated solutions available to SMEs in the cleaning sector.  MBS said it has already adopted two of the machines on show. The first is a robotic floor cleaner, Intellibot, that moves on its own. One can upload building blueprints into the Intellibot and is designed with sensors to detect dangerous corners and areas.     The second, SuperLizzy, is a self-service waste compactor that separates liquids from solids and cuts waste before crushing it, enabling waste thrown in to stay compact for a longer period of time.  With over 2,500 hotel rooms and an average occupancy of 90 per cent, Marina Bay Sands is constantly looking at improving our efficiency and effectiveness to remain successful ... In the long run, our goal is to optimise available technology to automate processes where possible so as to enable our staff to take on high-value jobs, said Mr Ian Wilson, senior vice president of hotel operations at MBS.

58,67,"Call them the new breed of pre-school teachers.  They are infinitely patient - they will repeat their questions as many times as required. And they are not likely to scold, even if poked or prodded by curious children.  Meet Pepper and NAO, two humanoid robots who have been helping out in two pre-schools here, under a six-month trial to see how robots can be used to teach children in interactive ways.  Pepper, a 1.2m robot with a touchscreen on its chest, has been reading stories like The Tortoise And The Hare to pupils at My First Skool Jurong Point. NAO, which is half of Pepper's height, has been interacting with pre-schoolers from MY World in Bukit Panjang by telling stories and even dancing.  The pre-schools are collaborating with the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) and Nanyang Technological University in this pilot.  Together, they ""explore the use of social-humanoid robots in early childhood through interactive storytelling and collaborative play"", said Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim, who announced the initiative at the opening of the Infocomm Media Business Exchange at Marina Bay Sands yesterday.  The collaboration is part of a larger push by the Government to work more closely with industry partners in its Smart Nation push to integrate technology and connectivity into everyday life in Singapore.  Another partnership announced yesterday is a pilot at Sentosa where solar panels will be used to power outdoor Wi-Fi access points in a green and cost-efficient way from now to September next year.  Visitors to the Merlion Walk will be able to access the Wireless@SG network while outdoors. These solar panels can cut the installation time of outdoor Wi-Fi by up to five times and the cost by up to half.  IDA is working with wireless networking firm Aruba, telco M1, local technology firm SkyLab and Sentosa Development Corporation in this trial. Visitors can also access outdoor Wi-Fi at Palawan Beach, Siloso Beach and Fort Siloso Skywalk. However, these points are not powered by solar panels.  ""If this pilot is successful, we could potentially expand Wireless @SG to reach more outdoor areas in a sustainable manner, and bring public Wi-Fi coverage in Singapore to the next level,"" said Dr Yaacob.  He also provided updates on the TechSkills Accelerator programme, launched in March, which aims to help job seekers pick up skills in the infocomm technology sector.  A governing council, made up of both government members and industry partners, has been set up to oversee the programme.

59,69,"Looking out of the window of his 15-storey HDB flat, businessman and father-of-two Alex Chin marvels at the scene before him.  Thirteen years ago, when he was 20, this flat located at Tengah, a former military training area in Singapore's west and ringed by a 100m-wide, 5km-long forest corridor, did not exist.  But if it did, he would have been looking out over a typical multistorey HDB carpark, full of a mix of sedans, SUVs, motorbikes, vans and pick-up trucks. Gantry bars would be rising and falling as the electronic parking system deducted payment from in-vehicle units.  Elderly residents would be making their way painstakingly across the road to get to the coffee shop for a bite.  Children would be getting off the bus from school.  Foreign workers might be yelling as they gesticulated to a rubbish truck backing up to a communal rubbish chute.  Now, there are far fewer parking spaces available, with land being set aside for other uses. In fact, the town centre at Tengah - Singapore's 24th HDB town - is entirely car-free, with an underground network of roads serving public buses and other vehicles.  Besides, technology has made cars with drivers redundant. Self-driving vehicles have proliferated in the form of taxi services and commercial vehicles transporting goods and freight to logistics centres from Changi East and the Tuas mega port - to which Singapore has been moving its port activities from Tanjong Pagar and Pasir Panjang.  There are also far fewer foreign workers collecting rubbish, thanks to an underground pneumatic waste collection system that collects all the rubbish that residents throw down the chutes and transports it by underground pipes to a centralised bin. The trash is later transported to incineration plants.  As he looks onto Tengah Reservoir in the distance, Alex sees a large, dark patch on the still waters. These solar photovoltaic systems, placed on floating platforms, are now a feature in every reservoir islandwide, providing clean energy to power Singapore's electric grid.  Hunger pangs remind Alex that it is time for dinner. He orders nasi briyani and rojak, which will be delivered to his block by drones.  He goes to the bedroom and urges his seven-year-old daughter to finish her online maths assignment from school.  Shortly later, his wife Priyanka returns to their flat. The 32-year-old data analyst has just commuted back via high-speed rail after a work trip to Kuala Lumpur.  They chat over dinner about what to do when they next have time off. She suggests Orchard Road, because while they can buy anything online from anywhere, there's that old-school buzz of seeing physical merchandise and being part of a happy crowd doing the perennial Singapore pastime of shopping.  The popular shopping belt has undergone a major revamp - a section has been entirely pedestrianised, there is a plethora of boutique shops selling local wares and there is a theme park that attracts tourists and shoppers alike.  Like Orchard Road, much else in Singapore has changed over the span of 13 years.  The Jurong Lake District has morphed into Singapore's second central business district, a transformation sparked by the 350km high-speed rail line linking Jurong East to Kuala Lumpur.  Pavements in the area are wide, and friendly to both pedestrians and cyclists. A bicycle-sharing system makes it easy for tourists to explore the area, while electric feeder buses ply the estate.  Unforeseen new technologies and companies have also emerged to disrupt industries and lifestyles, just how Uber and Airbnb did in the previous decade.  HOW IT CAME ABOUT  For Alex, 2017 was a milestone year as that was when a high-powered committee released a report that helped change the course of his career.  Back then, he was 20, had done his national service, and was taking the tried and true route that had the approval of his parents - studying accountancy. But then the Committee on the Future Economy report came out and his plan that would have seen him in a safe white-collar job seemed ill-equipped for a challenging future.  He realised that if he could combine the IT skills he had picked up out of interest with his awareness of robotics and his practical skills with numbers, he could start his own business based on his interests. He withdrew from his accounting programme and switched to reading biomedical engineering.  The Government was making it much easier to start a business by easing regulations to make it easier for start-ups to get funding from venture capital firms and providing more support for enterprises venturing overseas.  Society was also changing - risk-taking was encouraged and no longer so scary.  The education system was also shifting tack, helping children to find their own path among all the opportunities now laid out. The priority was shifting from academic excellence to picking up practical and soft skills, as well as taking on board the need for lifelong learning.  True, his parents were stuck in the old ways of thinking, being fixated on academic grades and opting for safe career choices like accounting and finance.  But look at his father - this safe way was no longer so safe. He had been made redundant twice from his job as a bank manager, but was looking at getting new skills to remain employable.  Anyway, at that age of 20, Alex had read the signs. Entrepreneurship was the way to go. If he could think of a product, develop it, make use of the grants available, the shared knowledge from peers and the hook-ups from government agencies, he could develop a home-grown business.  More than that, he could grow it beyond Singapore. The CFE report had signalled to him that the world was his oyster - make that, rice bowl.  So five years on found him having founded a company to manufacture components for robotic surgery systems.  His then-fledgling business received a boost in 2023, when it was awarded a contract to supply Singapore's Health Ministry with mechanical parts for robot-assisted surgery. That helped him develop a track record and paved the way for him to expand into Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia and Laos - members of the Asean Economic Community and the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.  He also received customised support and funding from IE Singapore to expand his business, which is headquartered in the Jurong Innovation District. The 600ha industrial park houses learning, research, innovation and production activities.  Entrepreneurs like Alex who have ventured into Singapore's regional hinterland have been critical to maintaining the country's growth.  Through a combination of remaining open to trade and investment, nurturing growth industries and equipping its workforce with deep skills, Singapore has managed to maintain growth of around 2 to 3 per cent each year, while its population increased to 6.9 million. It has remained open to foreign talent, even as it raised the criteria for employment pass applications. Manufacturing still accounts for close to 20 per cent of GDP.  These results have defied the expectations of observers who panned the CFE report for being too general, uninspiring and a rehash of old strategies when it was released 13 years ago.  Some attribute the good results to the Government and Singaporeans taking heed of the recommendations laid out, from focusing on skills above grades to remaining open to trade.  Another factor behind growth is the emergence of the digital economy, with more Singaporeans opting for careers in the data and cybersecurity industries.  When she isn't commuting to KL for work, Priyanka is based in Punggol, which has become a cluster for businesses in the digital, infocomm technology and cybersecurity fields.  The 32-year-old too, had taken the cue from the CFE report about how the digital economy was set to flourish. She thus opted to read data science in polytechnic and at university.  Alex wonders if their four-year-old son Elon will eventually work in the digital sector. That could happen, he thinks, if his son is posted to a vocation where he gets to learn cybersecurity skills during national service.  The number of career cybersecurity specialists has gone up, after the Ministry of Defence created new technology vocations within the Singapore Armed Forces to equip national servicemen with cyber warfare skills.  Alex pictures his son sitting in front of a computer terminal, learning how to write programs to counter malicious computer software - that would be a far cry from his own national service when he was a tank driver, he thinks.  The structural shifts in the economy have forced many to skill up or be left behind.  Priyanka's father, Mr Arjun Chikkarangappa, 59, had driven a prime mover transporting cargo around Tanjong Pagar Terminal for more than 20 years.  But when operations at Tanjong Pagar moved to the Tuas mega port in Tuas South, he found that automated guided vehicles had made his old job redundant.  The new Tuas mega-terminal - meant to be a showcase of new technologies that would boost productivity and reduce the reliance on manpower - was outfitted with automated yard cranes and self-driving vehicles that transported cargo.  Reluctant to give up working in the only industry he has known, Mr Chikkarangappa went for training to learn how to do basic programming for the automated vehicles.  An Industry Transformation Map for sea transport, coordinated by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, had highlighted the importance of helping older port workers reskill.  For Alex, constantly learning new skills and keeping abreast of new technologies has become essential.  As he whips out his hipster-retro iPhone 10 to book a self-driving Uber to the new Terminal 5 at Changi Airport for a work trip, he thinks about how the increased government support has made it much easier for businessmen like him to venture abroad.  The country has also evolved from just being a key site for companies' regional and corporate headquarters to a ""runway economy"" where new ideas can develop, and eventually take off.  As his plane leaves Singapore's third airport runway, he realises people like him have indeed become pioneers for the next generation - just as the CFE report urged.",2017-02-18,"What would the Singapore of tomorrow be like for an HDB household, ...

One way to meet this need is to encourage students to focus on so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and mathematics, according to the report by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) yesterday.  ""Despite significant indications of innovation and technological progress, enterprises in Singapore reported that costs and skills are the biggest barriers to upgrading technology, with lack of skills reported more frequently in Singapore than on average in Asean,"" the report said.  Singapore accounts for half of Asean's ""high-skill, technology-intensive"" manufacturing exports, followed by Thailand (19.6 per cent) and Malaysia (15.7 per cent).  The ILO also found that 56 per cent of the salaried workforce from Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam are at ""high risk"" of being displaced by technology in the next decade or two, with workers in the garments industry the most vulnerable.  The ILO surveyed 4,076 regional enterprises across the manufacturing and service sectors, including 301 from Singapore, as well as students from over 2,700 universities and vocational colleges, including 206 from Singapore.  Firms here named rising labour costs as the biggest threat they face over the coming decade.  The United Nations agency noted that the Singapore Government has taken steps to use new technology to deal with the skills shortage and mitigate rising labour costs. Earlier this year, for example, the Government earmarked over $450 million to expand the National Robotics Programme over the next three years.  ""Increased automation will also create considerable high-skilled work, as optimised robots and machinery will need capable technicians and engineers,"" the ILO noted.  It also warned that workers here ""are not immune to rising skills needs brought on by technology, and students need to be encouraged to focus on Stem subjects to meet the future needs of enterprises in Singapore"".  But the problem is more complex than that, argued CIMB Private Banking economist Song Seng Wun.  ""Even though we push students to go for engineering courses, maybe only one out of 10 ends up doing what they did in school. The rest move to a more lucrative sector like financial services,"" he said.  ""So it's a bread-and-butter issue, and closing that pay gap is where the difficulty lies.

The UK company will be investing $561 million as part of its commitment to the new facility, which hosts working labs where research and development teams can pool their cumulative hardware and software know-how to help advance the companys growing ambitions.  If youre only passingly familiar with Dysons work, you might be wondering what a company that makes vacuums needs with a half-million dollar tech facility with a focus the company says is on artificial intelligence, machine learning and software development. But Dyson has always emphasized its tech edge in the domestic cleaning hardware market, and its only doing more to push that advantage lately, including more work in robotics, computer visions systems and machine learning with products like its Dyson 360 Eye robot vacuum.  As you can see from the photos of the facility, the company also put a lot of engineering work into one of its most recent products, the Supersonic hair dryer. There has also been some speculation that Dyson could extend some of its expertise around electric motors and battery tech into the automotive space, though the company isnt saying much one way or another about those reports just yet.  Dysons new facility also includes what they call The Control Tower, which shows real-time supply chain and logistics data, and which they use to help ensure things run smoothly in terms of global production and shipping, and the new tech centre is very close to Dysons West Park production facility, where the company says one of its digital motors leaves the line every 2.6 seconds, thanks to highly automated production lines.  Dyson has already said that it will do much more in robotics, machine learning and robotics according to the engineer leading its robotics program, Mike Aldred, and it seems like this new tech center will help with those pursuits.

SINGAPORE: Local start-up Aitech Robotics and Automation (R&A) has developed a robotic prototype to make deliveries for food and beverage (F&B) outlets, it announced on Tuesday (Mar 29).  This robot can be deployed in F&B outlets or in office buildings to facilitate the delivery of orders, which customers can make through a mobile application. If deployed in an office building, it will also be able to sense the different levels in an elevator to make deliveries to the right floors.  The model will be ready for commercial sale in two months and will cost at least S$100,000, said Aitech R&A founder and director Mr Eric Lee.     There will also be an option to lease the robot for about S$30,000 to S$40,000 a year, he added.

The collaboration aims to provide a community space where children can take part in hands-on activities to create things using an array of tech toys and tools.  The PlayMaker Studio combines playing and tinkering, allowing children to experiment with materials to understand what they can do and create new solutions. Children can pick up a host of skills and hone their logical thinking and reasoning, all while bonding with peers.  This is part of ongoing efforts by SCS to spark a lasting interest among young children in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem). Together with IMDA, SCS will curate and update the collection of tech toys at the space to sustain and deepen that interest.  SCS chief Lim Tit Meng hopes this ""meaningful venture"" will inspire the next generation of tinkerers.  Said Associate Professor Lim: ""A tinkering and making mindset among young children can inspire them to inquire, investigate and innovate.""  IMDA chief Tan Kiat How said the space will help prepare children to live, play and work in a Smart Nation.  ""The workshops offered at PlayMaker Studio will help children develop logical thinking and sequencing at an early age, and prime them with the relevant skill sets to thrive in a digitally rich future,"" he added.  SCS and IMDA will conduct workshops and programmes, facilitated by KidsSTOP educators, for the community as well. Established makers might also be invited to the space, to share their passion and interest in tinkering and making.  The PlayMaker Studio aims to reach out to 3,500 children by the end of the year.  Check out these cool tech toys and how they teach young ones new skills.  What is it A cute, bee-shaped floor robot used to teach concepts such as sequencing (when one action leads to the next in a predetermined order), estimation and problem-solving.  What you do: Colourful and easy to operate, the Bee-Bot is controlled by directional keys on its back - just press them to move it forward and backward or left and right. You can create your own activities and games, and use the Bee-Bot to reach various objectives.  For example, place it on a mat covered with pictures of different types of food, and use it to choose healthy options to ""fill"" a plate.  What is it A robot kit - made up of various ""body parts"" and wooden blocks - that is designed for free play and teaches sequencing.  What you do: Build your very own robot and decorate it using Kibo parts and/or other materials, such as coloured paper or straws, and then make it do what you want.  The robot's body has a scanner that lets you scan barcodes printed on colour-coded wooden blocks. Each block's barcode contains an instructional code (for making it sing or spin, for example). When they are put together, the string of instructions will provide a sequence of actions for your Kibo to perform.  What is it A vibrating, motorised contraption that moves in unusual ways and leaves a mark to trace its path. It teaches general concepts about electrical circuits, among other things.  The outcome from each machine might vary because users can change the variables (such as the length and weight of the motors, the drawing method or the speed of the motors).  What you do: Each Scribbling Machine is unique, and usually consists of drawing tools and a motorised base.  Anyone can build and customise his own machine, using simple materials such as markers, masking tape and batteries.  Different machine designs produce different patterns, such as smooth or jagged lines, or circles in various sizes.  Varying the materials, which can include paint and paintbrushes, markers, chalk or colour pencils, for the machine's ""legs"" will result in varying patterns as well.",2017-03-05,"Not only are they being introduced and used widely in schools, but when Science Centre Singapore (SCS) and the Infocomm Media ...","Tech toys steal the show at school, playtime",http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/tech-toys-steal-the-show-at-school-playtime,4,4,1

65,77,"SINGAPORE - The Nanyang Technological University's (NTU) Institute for Media Innovation has unveiled its latest star inventions - a pair of robots.  Nadine is a female humanoid companion with a personality, while Edgar - made entirely in NTU - is an autonomous service robot.  But the duo are not the only robotic innovations that Singapore has produced.  Here's a look at a few others.     Minister for Communications and Information Yaacob Ibrahim (in red, seated) joining seniors in taking cues from Robocoach. PHOTO: IDA     Also known as: Fitness coach for seniors  The robot, unveiled in October 2015, uses motion-sensor technology to assist the elderly in doing their exercise routines correctly.  Originally developed by students from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, the robot has been deployed to at least one senior activity centre, and will eventually be placed in other centres across the island.  Robocoach is capable of engaging users in basic conversation and can respond to voice commands or questions.     Three of the four team members, (from left)Maksim Kolin, Khor Jie Hao and Hansen Goh,with their winning OBYS Robot prototype. PHOTO: ST FILE     Also known as: Waiter with ""super-vision""  Billed as being ""affordable, user-friendly and multi-functional"", it was created by four robot enthusiasts and won first prize in a competition organised by ST Electronics and Spring Singapore in October this year.  OBYS is best deployed as a waiter in restaurants and cafes - it is equipped with an ""electronic eye"" to detect obstructions 30m ahead (with a horizontal field of view of 270 degrees).  Customers can make their orders via an iPad attached to its head, while food and drinks are served on a tray above it.  Also known as: Robo-octopus or robo-stingray  The Straits Times reported in March this year on plans by the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology's (Smart) to develop a range of deep-sea robots to provide constant surveillance of the seas at low cost and with minimal use of energy.  For instance, a ""stingray"" prototype that its scientists developed cost just $1,000 and can collect data on its surroundings, such as water temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen.  Singapore's Tropical Marine Science Institute had previously used the robots to gather data on harmful algae blooms that plague local fish farmers.  Smart also came up with an octopus-inspired robot that is fast enough to follow dolphins for quick observation or even inspect thermal vents in the mid-ocean ridges.  Also known as: The smart one  Standing at 1.8m and weighing 80kg, Singapore's first humanoid-sized robot was touted as one of the world's smartest when it was unveiled in October 2011.  NTU scientists constructed Nash using lightweight aluminium and hardy plastics, and it took five years and a six-figure sum to build it.  The prediction then was that it would become commercially available within the next five years, with a price tag of about $200,000.  Nash, which stands for NTU Advance Smart Humanoid, can climb stairs, respond to simple voice commands and make decisions based on the information it gathers. It also has a 500-word vocabulary that helps it recognise objects such as apples and cups.  It can also lift up to 40kg on its back and 10kg in each hand.

67,80,"The Nanyang Technological University also recently signed a formal agreement with an Italian university to further research in areas like robot-assisted stroke therapy and surgery.  SINGAPORE: Physical therapy is one important step towards recovery for stroke victims. To offer patients a helping hand, a group of Nanyang Technological University (NTU) researchers has engaged the help of robotics.  They have developed the H-man, a robot that helps stroke patients relearn their movements through a simple computer game. It aims to be the first low-cost and portable robotic solution for stroke rehabilitation in Singapore.  We want to bring these robots to homes and community centres, where you can have multiple stations for patients to play, literally, with other patients or therapists, said Associate Professor Dominico Campolo. Basically, you can monitor the patients from the hospital. We are trying to decentralise healthcare.""  Some hospitals already use robots in stroke therapy, but Assoc Prof Campolo said the H-man is a cheaper alternative. Regular robots cost about S$200,000, while the H-man costs 20 to 25 per cent of that price.  Channel NewsAsia understands that the team will form a start-up by 2017, to commercialise the technology.  The H-man is one of the latest human robotics projects at NTU. Its researchers have delved into the area for the past few years. Recently, they have taken it a step further. The university signed a formal agreement with the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna (SSSA) during President Tony Tan Keng Yam's state visit to Italy in May, to further research in areas like robot-assisted stroke therapy and surgery.  ""NTU is very strong in this area, said NTUs Professor Louis Phee. SSSA is also a leader in this area in Europe, so I feel it makes sense for both universities to get together to do even more cutting-age research with the common goal to improve healthcare.""  Prof Phee has developed the Endomaster, an endoscope with two robotic arms attached. Doctors can control the arms through two joysticks.  ""These joysticks, just like a video game, will pick up the movements of your arms, he explained. And the view you see here will be the actual endoscopic view inside the patient's intestines. By manipulating the joystick, the two arms will move according to your hand movement. The left arm is fashioned as a grasper, where you can pick up tissue. You can use the right arm to slice away tissue.  This allows doctors to get rid of gastric cancers without leaving any scars. ""With robotics, the system can be made and designed to be very intuitive, so you can learn to use the system in a very, very short time, Prof Phee said. For the patients, we are not making additional holes, so you would expect shorter hospitalisation stays, and you would expect costs to go down; pain and trauma would also decrease dramatically.  ""In many developed countries, we have the ageing population, there are more and more older people. And in developed countries, we are also doing more inspection for such cancers, he added. ""So the more we find, then obviously we need to remove them. It makes sense to remove such cancers in the most minimally invasive manner.""  The Endomaster will be introduced into the market by 2018. Prof Phee hopes to use the system for gynaecological or ENT procedures next.",2016-06-08,"To offer patients a helping hand, a group of Nanyang Technological ... and portable robotic solution for stroke rehabilitation in Singapore.",NTU researchers use robotics to offer stroke patients a helping hand,http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ntu-researchers-use/2855798.html,4,5,5
68,81,"Koufu is trying out the use of robots at a few of its outlets.  THE next time you visit a Koufu food court, do not be surprised if a robot clears your food tray.  The food court operator is experimenting with the use of robots at a few of its outlets and has plans to roll them out islandwide.  The humanoid robots are equipped with sensors and racks. They move around tables and stop to allow customers to return their trays. The robots will then move to the washing area when their racks are full, where cleaners will unload the trays.  Testing robots is one of the ways that Koufu is tapping into technology to boost productivity.  Food and beverage outlets in Singapore have grappled with getting customers to return their food trays after finishing their meals. Koufu hopes that the tray return robots will address the problem. Cleaners will also be freed up from tending to tables.  Another way that Koufu is using technology to increase efficiency is having customers use an app on their mobile phones to order and pay for their food. Human errors are eliminated during the ordering process, and customers do not have to wait in line to make orders. The app also informs customers when their food is ready to be collected.  ""This (the app) would help in improving customers' waiting time and thus experience,"" said Pang Lim, Koufu's managing director.  Koufu started thinking about ways to improve its productivity in 2009 when it realised that boosting efficiency was essential to fuel growth in the business.  ""Increased productivity simplifies the operating process. This allows us to have a competitive edge over others, thus creating customers' value proposition for sustainable business growth,"" said Mr Pang.  The company also believes that being adaptable and staying efficient is a must for businesses to stay relevant in the new economy.  ""Disruptions from new technologies and new business models like Uber are affecting a lot of traditional businesses,"" said Mr Pang.  ""Our biggest challenge would then be our ability to adapt and transform our business so as to remain relevant to society, and be able to continuously create value propositions for our customers.""",2016-11-14,"The robots will then move to the washing area when their racks are full, ...

69,82,"Guests at a hotel here will soon have their room service orders delivered to them by talking robots.  From June, two robots will take on the roles of bellboy and housekeeper at Park Avenue Rochester Hotel, delivering bottled water, linen and toiletries and, later on, food, luggage and mail to guests' rooms.  The 311-room hotel in Buona Vista is the first hotel in Singapore to turn to robotics to cope with the labour shortage.  Techi the robot, developed by an American company, uses driverless technology and has sensors that prevent it from knocking into walls and people.  Techi will have the building map built into its system, enabling it to navigate the hotel and even ride the lifts on its own.  Commands can be keyed into the robot. Upon arriving outside a guestroom, Techi will ""call"" the guest, via the unique phone number linked to each room.  Guests who pick up the phone will hear an automated voice saying: ""Your order has arrived.""  The robots will help take some workload off the overstretched housekeeping team and allow the human staff to spend more time interacting with guests, said hotel general manager Ryan Sun.  The two robots, which cost $100,000 each and can carry loads of up to 80kg, can do the same amount of work as four full-time employees in a year.  The hotel has 22 people in its housekeeping team - about half of the 40 it needs - because it simply cannot find more workers.  ""It's not about how much we offer to pay. Nobody comes for the interviews,"" Mr Sun lamented.  The average age of the housekeeping staff, who work eight-hour shifts six days a week, is above 50. Pushing trolleys ladened with linen, which can weigh as much as 70kg, takes a toll on their health.  Mr Sun hopes the robots will lead not just to gains in productivity, but also fewer sick leave among his staff.  The concept of robots serving in hotels, while new to Singapore, has taken off overseas. One hotel in south-west Japan, for example, has been staffed almost entirely by robots since last July.  In Singapore, the workforce is estimated to grow by 1 per cent to 2 per cent annually until 2020.  Between last year and 2020, an estimated 13,300 hotel rooms will be added, representing a compound annual growth rate of 3.5 per cent, far outstripping workforce growth.  In the light of this manpower shortage, it is ""imperative for hoteliers to transform their processes through innovation and technology"", said Ms Ong Huey Hong, director of hotels and sector manpower at the Singapore Tourism Board.  ""We are encouraged by this first robotics project in the housekeeping function within the Singapore hotel industry, and hope that it will inspire more hotels to innovate as well,"" she added.  Park Avenue, which is spending a total of $285,000 to pilot its robot housekeepers project, is currently integrating the robotics system with the building's infrastructure. This includes changing some of its doors to auto doors and reconfiguring its lifts to ""communicate"" with the robots using Wi-Fi.  Going forward, Techi has the potential to push wheelchair-bound guests around. It can also do ""quality checks"" on rooms by scanning details such as whether towels are hung at the right length and if pillows are placed correctly.  The next challenge is human-related - whether guests and staff will take to the robots.  ""We have to educate customers to manage their expectations. Some guests may not like the idea, they still prefer the concierge, wearing a nice uniform, to greet them,"" said Mr Sun.  As for staff, ""we don't want them to feel that their jobs will be taken away"", he said. ""We want them to view the technology from a more positive angle. This will help them offload some of the duties rather than replace them.""",2016-02-06,"The concept of robots serving in hotels, while new to Singapore, has taken ... to transform their processes through innovation and technology, ...",Hotel to debut pair of robot service staff,http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/hotel-to-debut-pair-of-robot-service-staff,2,3,7
70,83,"A team of 10 students from Paya Lebar Methodist Girls' School (Secondary) (PLMGS) remembers the ""welcome"" they received when they entered the competition area for a regional robotics competition in Indonesia.  They were laughed at.  ""We were the only girls in a sea of boys,"" said Secondary 3 student Tan Jia Min, 15.  Pitted against over 300 boys from various Asian countries at August's World Robot Games, the girls set to work. ""At first we felt intimidated,"" admits 15-year-old Ling Yin, also in Sec 3. ""But we just kept trying.""  After tinkering with wires and voltages, and putting their robots through various obstacles, the team emerged victorious four days later, clinching 15 awards across 34 categories at the annual competition.  For the girls, the wins showed how far they had come in a short time. The school's robotics group had been established less than a year before.  When Mr Indra Ahmad, the school's Mathematics and Design and Technology teacher received an invitation for an earlier robotics contest in 2015, he decided to put together a group of students who were interested to give it a shot.  ""I didn't know anything about robotics then,"" said Sec 3 student Lee Wen, 15. ""But I grew to love it.""  After two months of preparation, the team ventured into the Asia Math & Engineering Competition 2015 with trepidation due to their own prejudices about girls and engineering. They came in second.  That made them hungry for more success.  Said Jia Min: ""We exceeded our own expectations and our competitors' expectations of us.""  The school went on to set up a robotics enrichment group this year. ""Because of the success at the competition, they were spurred to do even more,"" said the school's vice-principal, Ms Cheong May Lan, 57.  ""They were so motivated after seeing that there was nothing to stop girls from doing robotics.""  PLMGS, which first opened its doors a century ago in 1916, started out as a school for boys. The school started admitting girls a year later. In 1961, it became an all-girls school.  The school was invited to participate in the competition in Indonesia after doing well in the Singapore leg where it won first and second places in the search-and-rescue category, ahead of Woodlands Ring Secondary School.  With two months leading up to the World Robot Games, the team would meet once a week to plan. ""We had to start from scratch,"" said Mr Indra, 41, who joined the school in 2013. ""I had to break the lessons down to the basics.""  Competitors were given problems that had to be solved using robots. After weeks of brainstorming and trial and error, the team created three types of robots for the disaster recovery theme of the competition.  They created a search-and-rescue robot which could use a gripper to retrieve objects and pull and push things, a ""sumo"" robot that could simulate the pushing of big boulders and a robot that could follow floor maps to reach people that may be trapped or captured.  The competition in Indonesia, which saw 327 participants from five Asian countries, was not without hiccups.  ""When we arrived, we saw that the competition track had slopes. We were not prepared for that,"" said Mr Indra. The girls stayed up late into the night trying to reconfigure their robots.  PLMGS was Singapore's only representative. ""Students from other countries were also madly configuring their robots, plugging them in and out to test them. It was quite intimidating,"" said Lee Wen.  ""When it was our turn to send out our robots, everyone was staring at us. We were the outsiders,"" said Sec 2 student Christina Tan, 14.  But they made sure that did not faze them.  In addition to three gold awards, two silvers and two bronzes, they won eight performance awards, plus a spirit award for showmanship and perseverance.  ""It felt good to beat the boys, who people think are supposed to dominate robotics,"" said Ling Yin.  PLMGS has plans to venture deeper into the robotics arena, looking at future collaborations with tertiary institutions in the research field. Its robotics interest group has 35 students now. ""The sky is the limit for these girls,"" said Mr Indra.

TOKYO: Like the fictional superhero Iron Man, Mr Kenji Takemura from Osaka, Japan slips into a robotic suit and proceeds to lift the heavy boxes with great ease.  With an exoskeleton on his back, the 58-year-old handles these 40kg boxes like a man half his age, keeping work-related injuries at bay.  This wearable robot, developed by Activelink, a unit of Japanese tech giant Panasonic, reduces the energy required to carry heavy objects and cuts down the stress on the back by as much as 15 kg.  Mr Takemura said: Wearing this suit to work, it helps to take the stress off the legs and waist and it is really useful. I have been able to work for a longer period of time.  I am now 58 but using this, I am able to work till I am 65 or maybe 70.  According to a 2016 report by Japans welfare ministry, nearly 70 per cent of people aged 60 and above would like to work even after they turn 65. And such wearable robots could extend the working lives of older workers.  In Japan, 160 power-assist suits were sold between September 2015 and October 2016. Globally, sales of these suits  which cost about 1 million yen (S$12,000) each  are predicted to hit 10,000 by 2020.  Such advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence have re-defined work and re-calibrated skillsets, while killing certain jobs at the same time.  In an upcoming episode airing Sunday (Feb 26), Challenge Tomorrow looks at how countries like Spain, Japan, Singapore and Finland are grappling with how citizens can thrive in a technology-driven work landscape.  Finland, an economy once dominated by forestry-based industries, has redesigned its education system to embrace the digital age and the more collaborative working world of the future.  Ms Anita Lehikoinen, permanent secretary of Finlands Ministry of Education and Culture, estimated that a third of the jobs today would be replaced by automation, robotics and artificial intelligence in the near future.  But redesigning the education system, said Ms Lehikoinen, is not a case of simply embracing information and communications technology into learning programmes.  She said: Robots, automation, digital devices, they can take care of much of the work today. But where we need human beings are actually the soft skills. This is the new idea behind the new curriculum.  The curriculum introduced in August 2016 emphasis competencies across subjects with a focus on collaborative learning. It develops areas such as character-building and higher thinking skills.  With changes happening so rapidly in the world, it is difficult to say what will be in 20 years time. We want to prepare our children for the next decade, we need to provide them with more broader skills, such as critical thinking, Ms Lehikoinen said.  Or as Finnish upper secondary school student Elmo Torppa put it: I think its stupid to focus on a single profession because you cant know if it will be a real profession in 20 years. I would like to think that what I am going to do when I grow up is something that may not exist yet.  She studies in Espoo, which has been designated a UNESCO Learning City, where new ways of teaching are being tried out. For instance Elmos upper secondary school is located at Aalto University and shares its facilities.  The city is also trying out the new approach of flip learning. Said the Espoos director of development Kristina Erkkila: The idea is that what used to be taught in schools would be studied at home then students come to school and use their higher thinking and learning skills to collaborate in projects.  Its opening up to the real world more than traditional schools.

73,87,"More than 22,000 new jobs are projected to be created in the manufacturing sector in Singapore over the next eight years, such as for data scientists and robot coordinators, a new study has found.  These higher-value positions will pay on average 50 per cent more than current jobs displaced during this period, the study by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) added.  Observers say a key challenge will be to seize this window of opportunity in the sector by equipping workers to acquire the skills to fill new places.  Manufacturing accounts for a fifth of the Singapore economy and the sector has been hit hard by the current slowdown, but recently it has shown signs of a comeback.  Disruptive technologies have also impacted the sector, with some 23,000 jobs forecast to be displaced by 2024.  Last month, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Koh Poh Koon said the Government will continue to invest in advanced manufacturing to position workers and companies for the future.  The Committee on the Future Economy, which will release its report early next year, has also identified advanced manufacturing as a key growth sector.  Singapore Manufacturing Federation president Douglas Foo said manufacturing has to remain a core part of the economy.  ""If you do not manufacture the goods and services required by the world, and you just offer services, you can't play in the whole value chain any more and that weakens the entire construct of the economy,"" he told The Straits Times.  A key focus of the shift to higher- value manufacturing involves adopting Industry 4.0 technologies such as autonomous robots and cloud computing.  BCG's study found companies that adopt these will likely see revenues increase by some 10 per cent.  There will be spin-offs for the wider economy, as manufacturing output could go up by about 9 per cent, and labour productivity by some 28 per cent.  Said BCG partner and managing director Michael Meyer: ""If we are able to capture that potential, we could see some revitalisation of the manufacturing sector.""  The BCG study is based on case studies and data from 19 industries and assumes that firms with at least 500 full-time staff fully adopt Industry 4.0 technologies relevant to their industries over a 10-year period, while smaller companies see 60 per cent adoption.  Mr Michael Tan, a BCG principal and one of the study's authors, said it is important for Singapore to take advantage of the advanced manufacturing wave or it risks being left behind as other countries like Thailand catch up. He said: ""There's a relatively short window of opportunity for a small, open economy like Singapore to catch this trajectory.  ""In industries where Singapore is part of existing supply chains, if we're not careful, we could be displaced, but it also opens a window for us to capture things that we are currently not able to do here, if we can do them in a smarter way.""  He added that companies should not underestimate the degree of change needed. ""They may think it's just buying a new robot or software. But there's another set of investments in redesigning work processes, factories and the management process,"" he said.  This includes helping workers understand and embrace changes.  Mr Albert Loh, chief executive of electronics manufacturer PTS Technologies, finds that the global shift to advanced manufacturing has worked to his advantage.  He saw his contract manufacturing work moving towards a dead end and, in 2012, his company started designing and making remote sensing technology for the agriculture sector, such as radio frequency identification trackers for farm animals and sensors that monitor temperature, humidity and soil conditions.  ""We had to do a lot of training for staff. Engineers had to learn to work with new technology and marketing staff had to understand the new products,"" he added.  But it was worth it, as business went up by 10 per cent to 12 per cent, and he is trying to hire more staff to join his team of 23, he said.",2016-11-27,"Over 22,000 new jobs likely in Singapore manufacturing by 2024 ... years, such as for data scientists and robot coordinators, a new study has found. ...

Singapore offers a variety of environments to conduct ICT trials in a real-life settings, from mixed-use urban areas such as Jurong Lake District in the west, to housing estates like Yuhua and Punggol, and even Sentosa, our very own island getaway, said Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,Minister for Communications and Information.  The Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) is currently conducting a pilot study on the use of social robots in early childhood education. The study aims to test the impact of social robots in early childhood education and to gain insights into how robots can used in pre-schools in future. Understanding how children respond to and interact with robots could support the lesson designs of future learning technologies.  The 7-month pilot study is conducted at two pre-school centres in partnership with Softbank Telecom Singapore and NTU Robotics Research Centre. Two social robots, Pepper and NAO, will be used to test usage in areas of collaborative play and interactive storytelling. During the pilot study, use cases, robot applications and lesson plans will be developed, and teachers will be trained to facilitate the lessons with the use of robots.  Our children love to play with and learn together with robots, hence we believe that robots can benefit our children in schools, and this partnership supports a new paradigm for us to plan and design learning and creativity to allow our children to explore and co-construct knowledge, said Thian Ai Ling, Deputy General Manager of My First Skool.  In partnership with Aruba, M1, Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) and Skylab, the Green Wi-Fi Pilot will explore ways to expand the pervasiveness of Wi-Fi into outdoor spaces. The pilot will trial Wi-Fi deployment using wireless backhaul technology and solar panels to power and enable broadband services in a cost effective and environmentally sustainable manner.  The pilot is slated to start in June 2016 across a 15 month period. IDA and SDC will look into the pilot results and consider deploying outdoor Wireless@SG hotspots at more locations across the island.  Traditionally, developing Wifi outdoors has been difficult and costly, due to the trenching works required. As such, most of the Wireless@SG hotspots are indoors. If this pilot is successful and I believe it will, we could potentially expand Wireless@SG to reach more outdoor areas in a sustainable manner, and bring the public Wifi coverage in Singapore to the next level, said Dr Ibrahim.  Mobile data traffic in Singapore to grow exponentially from approximately 3.1 petabytes per month in 2010 to approximately 37 petabytes per month in 2015, growing at an annual compound rate of 64%. To mitigate the potential crunch in wireless spectrum usage and available traffic capacity, IDA is exploring HetNet as a strategy to provide seamless connectivity everytime and everywhere, indoors and outdoors.  Conducted with the participation of telcos M1, MyRepublic, Singtel and StarHub, the trials have commenced since April 2016 at the Jurong Lake District, covering locations such as lifts, pedestrian walkways, the bus interchange and MRT train station.  Through these trials, industry players will evaluate efficient and optimal solutions to easing network congestion in areas with heavy human traffic and providing uninterrupted high-speed Internet access to users as they move from homes to public areas such as train stations. They will also test new methodologies, using small cells to boost mobile coverage in areas where macro coverage is weak, such as lifts or void decks.  Existing deployments of LTE leverage on a duplexing technique called Frequency Division Duplex (FDD). For these trials, besides LTE-FDD, some participants will be using a new duplexing technique called Time Division Duplex (TDD) which enables more flexibility in spectrum utilization. One of the objectives of thetrials is to enable the interworking of LTE-FDD and LTE-TDD so that mobile devices may access both networks seamlessly.  By harnessing all available networks across different parts of the wireless spectrum, HetNet can increase Singapores overall wireless capacity and hence data speeds. This will not only improve user experience but also meet the growing demand for mobile connectivity and usage of bandwidth intensive applications.  Consumer devices will be able to roam across different environments covered by networks of different wireless technologies and maintain seamless access to internet services. Therefore, users are more likely to remain connected even when a particular network is down.  Tests conducted at the Jurong East train station showed a significant 65.67% improvements in average download speeds and 21.21% improvements in upload speeds.  Data centres accounted for 7% of Singapores total energy demand in 2012, and are projected to reach 12% of its total energy demand by 2030 due to continued growth of data centres based here.  Collaborating with industry and experts, IDA will develop and deploy the worlds first Tropical Data Centre (TDC). This proof-of-concept will establish the feasibility of operating data centres in a tropical environment, such as with ambient temperatures of up to 38 degrees Celsius and ambient humidity levels exceeding 90%.  IDA estimates that up to 40% of energy consumption could be reduced should the trial prove successful. This would cut carbon emissions and energy savings can be quickly implemented globally as well.Globally, data centres are kept consistently cooled to between 20-25 degrees Celsius with ambient relative humidity of between 50-60%. A data centres main operating cost is therefore usually spent on energy consumption in maintaining such controlled environments.  Allowing for higher ambient temperatures and humidity would thus have immediate cost saving impact if the trial shows it is possible to run data centres in hot tropical and humid climates common in Southeast Asia.The trials will be conducted with simulated server loads to reflect live situations such as sudden peak surges, low-usage, and large amounts of data transferred between networks and storage devices. The trials will be run continuously (24 hours, 7 days a week) alongside a control setup.  Mr Khoong Hock Yun, Assistant Chief Executive, IDA said, With Singapores continued growth as a premium hub fordatacentres, we want to develop new technologies and standards that allow us to operate advanceddatacentres in the most energy efficient way in atropicalclimate. New ideas and approaches, such as raising either the ambient temperature or humidity, will be tested to see if these can greatly increase our energy efficiency, with insignificant impact on the criticaldatacentre operations. To create new value in our Smart Nation journey, we need to embrace an attitude of experimentation, to be willing to develop new ideas together, and test the feasibility of progressive and positive technological advancements that has a good possibility to enhance our industry's competitiveness.""",2016-06-27,"Singapore's ICT trials - social robots, solar-powered Wi-Fi, HetNet and ... trial Wi-Fi deployment using wireless backhaul technology and solar ...","Singapore's ICT trials - social robots, solar-powered Wi-Fi, HetNet ...",http://www.enterpriseinnovation.net/article/singapores-ict-trials-social-robots-solar-powered-wi-fi-hetnet-and-tropical-data-centres,7,1,3
75,89,"Emma the physiotherapy robot helps to relieve muscle strains and injuries using acupoint therapy.  AsianScientist (Jul. 27, 2016) - On your next visit to the physiotherapist, don't be surprised if you are attended to by a robot.  Expert Manipulative Massage Automation (Emma), a physiotherapy robot designed and built by a Singapore-based start-up called AiTreat, specializes in using acupoint therapy to relieve muscle strains and injuries.  We have designed Emma as a clinically-precise tool that can automatically carry out treatment for patients as prescribed by a physiotherapist or Chinese physician, said Mr. Albert Zhang, founder of AiTreat. This is probably the first such robot in the world developed specifically for use by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) physicians and sports therapists. Our aim is not to replace the therapists who are skilled in sports massage and acupoint therapy, but to improve productivity by enabling one therapist to treat multiple patients with the help of our robots.  Emma consists of a single, six-axis robotic arm capable of highly articulated movements, a 3D-stereoscopic camera for vision, and a customized, fully rotatable 3D-printed massage tip. In-built safety features, which work in tandem with advanced pressure sensors, ensure the comfort and safety of its patients.  So far, Emma has treated patients with different conditions, such as tennis elbow, stiff neck and shoulders, lower back pain and muscle pulls.  To ensure a consistent quality of therapy, Emma has sensors and diagnostic functions that will measure the progress of the therapy and the exact stiffness of a particular muscle or tendon. These detailed diagnostics are uploaded to the cloud where the progress of each patient can be analyzed and generated into a performance report.  AiTreats propriety cloud intelligence is supported by Microsoft, after Zhang and his teammates won the Microsoft Developer Day Start-up Challenge earlier this year.  Zhang said that the robotic arm may resolve some of the challenges faced by sports therapy clinicsa shortage of trained therapists and a need to consistently deliver high-quality therapy, to name a few. Emma is currently undergoing user trials at a local sports science and Chinese medicine clinic.  Source: Nanyang Technological University.

76,90,"A little known fact about one of Singapores most environmentally friendly and progressive townsis that it was named after a tree, the Streblus elongatus. Known as Tempinis to locals, the trees were once found in abundance in the area that is now a bustling residential area and living laboratory for green lifestyle technology.  Tampines town is a sustainabilityleader on many fronts. It recently installed refrigerators in the communal space at the bottom of a public housing block to collect fooddonationsto feed needy residents.Opened in 2011, Tampines Eco Green park was built with recycled material and is the first public park in Singapore with an eco-toilet, in which bacteria and wood shavings are used to decompose human waste into compost.  More recently, however, the town located in the east of Singapore has become home to Our Tampines Hub (OTH), the first integrated community centre and a beacon of sustainability. Owned by government statutory board Peoples Association, OTH is running trials for a few programmes that will lighten its environmental footprint and wants to encourage environmental awareness among the youth in Tampines, according to director Suhaimi Rafdi.  Phase one was launched in November last year with a public service centre, shops, auditorium and hawker centre now open to public. The second and third phases willintroducea bowling alley, karaoke studio, stadium, performing arts centre and swimming pools, and are expected to wrap up before the year end to service the more than 239,100 public housing residents in Tampines, one of Singapores most populous towns.  Suhaimi said that OTH can act as a living laboratory for community centres.Its tried-and-tested technologies could beadopted by the next four community centres up for redevelopmentbythe Peoples Association, though none on the same scalegiven their much smaller plot size and visitorship. The four are: Punggol, Bedok, Sembawang and Yishun.  Heres how OTH is making Tampines one of the most eco-friendly residential zones in Singapore.  One programme that is up and running is OTHs food waste programme that consists of two one-tonne digesters that turn food waste from the supermarket, restaurants and hawker centre into organic fertiliser and non-potable water, which is used to clean OTH facilities and the machines themselves. Thefertiliser is distributed to Tampines residents and gardening clubs once a month.  Suhaimi cited the growing concernoverfood waste as a reason for purchasing the two digesters, which cost half a million Singapore dollarsin total. At present OTH generates 700kg in food waste every day and Suhaimi estimates this amountto double to 1.5 tonnes a day once OTH is fully open.  But that figure is expected to plateau oncethe centre gets its educational programmes for studentsoff the ground, and teaches them to be mindful of the waste they generate, said Suhaimi.Headded that OTH has begun welcoming students on school excursions to see how the digester works. Use of the on-site digesters is also written into the tenancy contracts for food-and-beverage and supermarket tenants to ensure buy-in.  WhileSuhaimi said it was too early to gauge the impact of the eco digesters, he said OTH has saved on savings are likely to made inhaulage costs, transportation fees, carbon emissions andlandfill space. The goalis to pass on savings made to tenants in the form of rebates. Well tabulate our savings on an annual basis and they will be distributed by per square foot of net lettable area, explained Suhaimi.  Developed nations are ageingand Singapore is no different, with a shortage inmanpower becoming more of an issue. With that in mind, OTH is trialling a number of intelligent Internet-of-Things solutions to reduce thereliance on labour.  Dotted around the community centre are waste bins called Clean Cubes that can compact trashand therefore contain up to eight times the normal volume. The solar-powered bins alert cleaners only when they are full and need to be emptied.  The same applies with the community centres smart toilet system that is able to detect which toilets are most frequently used and their odour levels, alerting cleaners via SMS or email when the toilets require fresheningup.Manpower is therefore directed to where it is needed the most.The smart toilet system has also been adoptedbyother buildings including The Fullerton Hotel, Singapore Zoo and Pathlight School.  Autonomous, intelligent robot cleaners may be a common sight at OTH in the near future. The community centre is running a trial in collaboration with a local cleaning company Clean Solutionsfor a robot cleaner tosweep and mop the floors.  Suhaimi said the robot is a S$100,000 investment on the part of the cleaning company. A pilot test was successfullyrunat Changi Airport where the floors are carpeted, but results have been less promising at OTH. The robot cleaner at OTHhas to sweep and mop the hard floors, instead of just vacuuming as with carpeted floors, and it is being fine tuned.  OTH aims to put therobot cleaner to workby March and has the option to order more after the successful completion of its trial period.  Sustainability was built into OTH from the ground up. The visitor immediately notices that despite the lack of air-conditioning the building remains cool in the mid-day heat, thanks to the combination of the gigantic fans whirring overhead and natural ventilation as a result of itsdesign.  Drawn up by local architecture firm DP Architects, OTH was awarded the Building and Construction Authoritys Green Mark Award (Platinum) label last year, indicating that the building has demonstrated that it is energy efficient.  Construction involved the reuse of concrete waste from the demolished stadium building, while a new energy-efficient chiller plant was installed. LED lights are used extensively throughout the community centre and, when completed, the building will featurea green facade of plants.  Taken all together it is estimated that the finished OTH building will make annual savings of 8,715,330 kWh of energy, enough to power 1,701 four-room HDB flats for a year, and357,193cu m of water, enough to fill 142 Olympic-size swimming pools.  In line with Singapores push to become a Smart Nation, where technology is used to empower and enrich the lives of its citizens, OTH has also introduced a host of ICT systems to improve the visitor experience and increase footfall.  Security cameras are currently being used to track the number of visitors to OTH each day. Once the community centre is fully open, avideo analytics function will be switched ontorecognise visitors by age band, sex and race and track where in the community centre they are visiting. The information is attachedand stored with anonymous serial numbers so visitors are not personally identifiable.  The information will be used to monitor traffic, review events and event programming, and maximise the use of manpower in addition to keeping track of visitorship.  Another example is how the OTH app, set to be launched later this year, will be able to remember where in the 1,400-lot carpark visitors have parkedand show users the quickest route to their ride.  OTH also plans to launch an integrated ticketing system which visitors can use during events to access all ofthe community centres existing facilities with the use of a single ticket. To be launched when the whole development is ready, the system will let operators know where in OTH people are visiting, which activities are popular and therefore make smarter decisions in resource deployment.",2017-02-09,"Industrial size food composters, robot cleaners and Internet of ....

77,91,"""What do you want to be when you grow up""  We often ask children that, without expecting them to know.  How could they Especially in today's context, when 65 per cent of children entering primary school are likely to end up in a job that does not exist yet, according to a World Economic Forum report.  Advances in technology have transformed the job landscape, and none more so than the breakthroughs in automation - or rise of robots, as some call it.  As far back as 2013, an Oxford study already concluded that almost one in every two jobs has a high risk of being automated.  A separate Infosys survey earlier this year showed four out of 10 youths believe machines will be able to do their jobs within a decade.  The truth, as always, is somewhere in between.  Yes, 45 per cent of activities people are paid to do could be automated with today's technology, according to an analysis by the McKinsey Global Institute. But fewer than 5 per cent of occupations can be fully automated. Man remains essential.  What automation means is that more time will be freed up for us to take on higher value work. Consider these likely possibilities for design and engineering jobs in 2020.  Robots are great for precise, repetitive work but not so great for creative, expressive work.  The chef who understands flavour combinations and how to create an inventive meal is not going away anytime soon, but menial tasks such as chopping onions and carrots may be better handled by a robot.  Robots are only now becoming capable of doing this task. Every vegetable presents variations in size, weight and shape, which robots are adjusting to with the help of artificial intelligence - or what we call machine learning.  Software is at the heart of robots, and as they take on more varied and nuanced jobs, the need for humans rises.  This paves the way for the creation of new jobs, such as robot trainers to demonstrate complex tasks for robots to learn and perform. Even in the manufacturing space where robots are widely deployed, we see a growing need worldwide for skilled manpower to operate them.  This is also likely to be the case here as the Government looks to scale up the use of robots among manufacturing SMEs, as part of the Industry Transformation Programme announced in the 2016 Budget.  The cloud has given us infinite computing capabilities. For instance, in the design field, software that can generate up to thousands of designs for a single product based on criteria - such as weight, strength, cost, size, materials - is emerging.  We call this generative design. For example, Autodesk worked with Airbus to build a lighter, stronger and more environmentally compatible aircraft. Using a combination of machine learning, 3D printing and generative design technology, Airbus has produced an aircraft cabin component, a bionic partition, 45 per cent lighter than current designs.  If applied to the entire cabin and the current backlog of A320 planes, this could save up to 465,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions a year by Airbus estimates.  This is the equivalent of taking about 96,000 passenger cars off the road for one year, feeding into global efforts to lower carbon emissions as part of the Paris Agreement.  A computer can assist a designer by providing thousands of design options.  The creative inputs of a human - this is, a generative designer - then come into play in defining the design parameters and setting the machine's learning objectives, in order to choose the option that best meets what the user is looking for.  This is similar to what data analytics specialists are doing today in finding insights from Big Data and converting Big Data into smart and usable data.  Also in time, sensors on machines and devices will be able to communicate with other sensors directly, and not through a medium such as a central computer or a smartphone app.  The fitness tracker today only senses and breaks down your level of activity. An evolved fitness tracker could also act on it and place an order for groceries with Redmart and Honestbee that will help in recovery when it senses you have completed a marathon. However, we need someone to set up this stage - a sensor system integrator, for lack of a better term. This job might not exist at the moment, but it will have to as associated technologies continue to mature.  Technology is advancing at a quick pace, cutting across a wider segment of industries, and effecting more transformations than ever. The possibilities presented by increased collaboration between machines and man go beyond jobs and economy. Together we can create solutions to problems that humans could never conceive. Already we are enjoying the results of these developments such as autonomous vehicles.  To venture further, we need to embrace the opportunities technological progress provides. Thankfully, with the rise of robots, we can soon afford the mind space to explore these possibilities and bring about a better future.  The writer is regional director of Asean at Autodesk.

79,93,"While robots have been around for years, advances in technology and artificial intelligence have allowed developers to give them traits that enable the devices to be seen as members of the family.  LAS VEGAS: Professor Einstein rolls his eyes, sticks out his tongue, and can give a simple explanation of the theory of relativity. With his lifelike rubbery ""skin"" and bushy mustache, he can almost make you forget he's a robot.  The Einstein robot is among dozens roaming the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas that can be your companion, educator or babysit your children.  While robots have been around for years, advances in technology and artificial intelligence have allowed developers to give them traits that enable the devices to be seen as members of the family.  ""We make robots that have personality and come to life,"" said Andy Rifkin, chief technology officer of Hanson Robotics, the Hong Kong-based firm which is bringing the US$299 Einstein robot to consumers this year.  Einstein is the first commercial product from Hanson, which became known for producing humanoid robots like the flirtatious ""Sophia,"" which has life-like facial and eye expressions and can converse through cloud-based artificial intelligence.  Einstein, which is knee-high and responds to voice commands, can help kids with their homework, play games and answer questions about math and science.  ""This is different from other robots,"" said Rifkin, who noted that the ""emotional bond"" can be an important element in helping kids learn.  Most other robots at CES look like the mechanical objects people expect from science fiction, but many have personality too.  Kuri, a knee-high rolling robot set to hit the US market, is touted as a home companion which can entertain kids and allow users to monitor their homes through a smartphone application.  ""You have to make an effort to give a robot personality and character, otherwise it's too cold,"" said Mayfield Robotics chief executive Michael Beebe. ""Kuri adds a spark of life to the home. The joy of incorporating a robot in the home is unique and magical.""  Mayfield, a 40-person California startup owned by German conglomerate Bosch, plans to deliver Kuri by December for US$699 to US consumers.  Kuri learns to recognize family members and can notify its owners through a smartphone when a child arrives home.  Kuri ""speaks only robot"" - meaning beeps and bloops, according to Beebe - but also offers a range of emotional expressions by rolling her head and moving her eyes. She can also play music to recorded sound, which Beebe uses to tell the robot to tell his dog to get off the couch.  AvatarMind, a robotics firm with offices in China and California, used CES to showcase its soon-to-be-released iPal ""social robot"" which can play games, converse in natural language, sing songs and monitor home security.  A little taller than one meter (3.5 feet), iPal can self-navigate and use its arms while singing or dancing.  CEO John Ostrem said the robot - which is being released in China early this year and in the US later in the year - can act as a companion for children or the elderly, and could be used as an assistant for commercial applications for information in shopping malls or hospitals.  Ostrem said that ""an interesting application is for children with special needs,"" because it can allow a therapist to care for numerous children with the help of the robot.  Chinese startup Roobo meanwhile announced the global launch of its tabletop PuddingBeanQ robot, designed for early child education. The voice-activated robot with a rudimentary electronic face can tell stories and teach children about music, or help learn a second language.  Chen Yi, the vice president of Roobo, said the voice system is better for young children than using a tablet or smartphone.  ""Parents do not want their children using a smartphone or tablet because of the screen,"" he said, adding that the robot's screen filters out harmful blue light.  Also at the show was a chess-playing robot - one which picks up the pieces and moves them - from Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute. The robot can also pour perfect cups of coffee.  Japan's Softbank Robotics meanwhile announced a partnership that will allow its humanoid robot Pepper to travel onboard SNCF trains in France to assist travelers.  Beebe said consumers are ready for these kinds of robots in homes and business.  ""As a kid we've always wanted to have a robot and now we have one,"" he said.  Hanson Robotics founder David Hanson said these new robots are delivering new kinds of human-computer experiences.

80,94,"The Hyper Tube Express could cut traveling time from Seoul to Busan from three hours to 20 minutes.  AsianScientist (Feb. 1, 2017) - Eight South Korean organizations have signed a memorandum of understanding to develop a supersonic Hyperloop train, the Hyper Tube Express (HTX). The multi-year strategic partnership aims to accelerate the realization of governments plan to build a futuristic transportation system.  The signing ceremony was attended by President Jung Mooyoung of Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Mr. Hwang SeungGu from the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI)'s Hyper-connected Communication Research Laboratory, Director Choa Yong Ho of Hanyang University, President Lee Tae Sik of Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology, President Kim Ki Hwan of Korea Railroad Research Institute (KRRI), President Lim Yong Taek of Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials, President Lee Chang Woon of Korea Transport Institute, and President Park KyungYup of ETRI.  HTX is an ultra-fast transit system powered by magnetic attraction that would move at nearly 1,000 km per hour. This means traveling from Seoul to Busan would only take about 20 minutes. The trip is currently a little less than three hours on the Korea Express Train, more popularly known as the KTX.  UNIST, the only university involved in the collaboration, will be in charge of the design and implementation of the magnetic levitation system of the HTX. Currently, UNIST researchers are working on the designs for both HTX and its station building.  According to UNIST Professor Jung Yeon Woo, the train is 21 meters long and could carry up to 20 passengers. The station is designed as a round three-dimensional platform capable of rotating and circulating in order to prevent multiple trains entering into history at short intervals due to the super-fast operating speeds.  A key element of hyper tube technology, the air compressor sucks in air in front of the train to reduce the air friction and air resistance in the tube. UNIST researchers are analyzing the air flow system and studying the power supply system to ensure the stability of the train body.  KRRI said it will test electromagnetic and other core technologies while developing a blueprint for general infrastructure such as tubes. The institute will oversee the system engineering for three years. KRRI had already committed 24 billion won (~US$21 million) for nine years as a project endorsed by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning.  Across the world, countries including the United States, Canada, and China are doing their utmost to develop a new form of ultra high-speed transportation system, said UNIST President Jung. This partnership will play a pivotal role in contributing to the lives of human beings as well as securing the nation's future growth engine by taking advantage of the core technology of the core components of the hyper tube.

81,95,"TOKYO (REUTERS, AFP) - Toyota on Monday (Sept 3) unveiled a doe-eyed, palm-sized robot, dubbed Kirobo Mini, designed as a synthetic baby companion in Japan, where plummeting birth rates have left many women childless.  Toyota's non-automotive venture aims to tap a demographic trend that has put Japan at the forefront of ageing among the world's industrial nations, resulting in a population contraction unprecedented for a country not at war, or racked by famine or disease.  ""He wobbles a bit, and this is meant to emulate a seated baby, which hasn't fully developed the skills to balance itself,"" said Mr Fuminori Kataoka, Kirobo Mini's chief design engineer. ""This vulnerability is meant to invoke an emotional connection.""  Toyota plans to sell Kirobo Mini, which blinks its eyes and speaks with a baby-like high-pitched voice, for 39,800 yen (S$530) in Japan next year. It also comes with a ""cradle"" that doubles as its baby seat designed to fit in car cup holders.  ""We want to address growing issues in society where people have no one to talk to,"" said Mr Moritaka Yoshida, a senior managing officer at Toyota.  The Toyota baby automaton joins a growing list of companion robots, such as the upcoming Jibo, designed by robotics experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that resembles a swivelling lamp, and Paro, a robot baby seal marketed by Japanese company Intelligent System as a therapeutic machine to soothe elderly dementia sufferers. Around a quarter of Japan's population is over 65 with a dearth of care workers putting a strain on social services.  Exacerbated by a reluctance to invite immigrants to bolster its working-age population, Japan's demographic crunch shows little sign of easing, with the government looking at robots to replenish the thinning ranks of humans.  In the past half century, births in Japan have halved to around a million a year, according to government statistics, with one in 10 women never marrying. Births out of wedlock are frowned upon in Japan and are much less common than in Western developed nations.  Japan is already a leading user of industrial robots. It has the second-biggest concentration after South Korea with 314 machines per 100,000 employees, according to the International Federation of Robots. New technology to help them better interact with humans means robots have begun moving beyond factory floors into homes, offices, shops and hospitals.

Mr Gribson Chan, the deputy director of the hospital's rehabilitation services division, said: ""With the robotic automation, we see 20 per cent more improvements in the upper limb functions of patients than those who undergo conventional treatment. We can also serve 20 per cent more patients.""  Mr Chan said the four robots, which were introduced to the hospital in January last year (2015)  were funded by the Agency for Integrated Care's (AIC) Healthcare Productivity Fund.  The biennial awards which was introduced by AIC in 2014, recognises community care healthcare professionals and organisations for their work in delivering quality care and service to their clients.  There were six broad award categories - three for outstanding staff members, and three for teams that implemented outstanding projects in the areas of service quality, improvement in productivity and innovation, among others.  More than 200 recipients from 23 organisations received awards. They included clinical professionals and administrators to care staff and home care providers.  Other award winners included Orange Valley Nursing Home at Sims Avenue which recreated a kampung-style garden area within the home so the five senses of residents could be engaged. The Home was given a merit under the Productivity and Innovation Award.  Meanwhile, Touch Seniors Activity Centre, won gold for improving its service quality. It recruited its more able senior clients as volunteers to befriend and support frail and homebound seniors in the community.  Senior Minister of State for Health and the Environment and Water Resources Dr Amy Khor who officiated the event, said the focus will continue to be on improving quality as services are ramped up to meet the needs of Singapore's ageing population.  She said: ""Patients' expectations of care are increasingly rising... We are growing capacity across home, centre-based and nursing home care to ensure our seniors can access care when they require it. We need to ensure that existing and new services are delivered with a high quality of care.""  She highlighted several ways in which the Government has been encouraging and helping to encourage more quality community care.  For instance, the Government is in the process of awarding about $8 million in funding to innovative projects under its Care-at-Home Innovation Grant.  The grant falls under the $200 million that has been set aside for the National Innovation Challenge on Active and Confident Ageing. More details on the grant will be released later this year.  Dr Khor added that the Government has several other initiatives that both support and fund projects dedicated to improving community care.  Financial support for the sector is also available through its Healthcare Productivity Fund which supports initiatives to adopt technology and conduct training and skills upgrading, among other things.  She said that the Ministry of Health has also developed and released guidelines for home care and centre-based care last year (2015), in consultation with the industry.",2016-09-28,SINGAPORE - Rehabilitation robots that help post-stroke patients regain ...

83,98,"Philippe Starck-designed hotel M Social in Singapore has launched its first robotic butler.  Developed by San Francisco-based robot manufacturer Savioke, the robot  called AURA  has been designed to free up hotel staff from delivery duties, and is capable of moving around the hotel supplying bottles of water, fresh towels, toiletries and room service to guestrooms.  On top of thisfunctionality, AURA has been programmed with its own personality, displaying traits of trustworthiness, politeness and dependability. It has also been wired to work alongside hotel staff and to engage with guests, communicating through a tablet face that shows information on services it provides andinstructions on how to interact with it.  Using wifi and 3D cameras to get around, the AURA robot has been adopted in a number of US hotels, including Aloft Cupertino, Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles and the Crowne Plaza San Jose.  Commenting on AURAs capabilities, CEO at Savioke Steve Cousins said:  If you put an item into AURA and tell her where to go, she will deliver it and then return to the docking station by herself. AURA can operate and ride in elevators, navigate her way to a guests door, let them know that a delivery has arrived (guest phone rings), and then open its lid for guests when they answer the door.
